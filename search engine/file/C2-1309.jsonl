They are well-loved animals that no one wants to see disappear. But, now, scientists fear the real impact of declining wildlife could be closer to home, with the threat to creatures such as ladybirds posing the gravest danger to biodiversity. \nClimate change, declining numbers of animals, rising numbers of humans and the rapid rate of species extinction mean a growing number of scientists now declare us to be in the Anthropocene \u2013 the geological age of extinction when humans finally dominate the ecosystems. \nWWF\u2019s Living Planet Index (LPI) 2014 seemed to confirm that grim picture, with statistics on the world\u2019s wildlife population that showed a dramatic reduction in numbers across countless species. The LPI showed the number of vertebrates had declined by 52% over four decades. Biodiversity loss has now reached \u201ccritical levels \u201d. Some populations of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians have suffered even bigger losses, with freshwater species declining by 76% over the same period. \nBut it\u2019s the creatures that provide the most \u201cnatural capital\u201d or \u201cecosystem services\u201d that are getting many scientists really worried. Three quarters of the world\u2019s food production is thought to depend on bees and other pollinators such as hoverflies. Never mind how cute a panda is or how stunning a tiger \u2013 it\u2019s worms that are grinding up our waste and taking it deep into the soil to turn into nutrients, and bats that are catching mosquitoes and keeping malaria rates down. A study in North America has valued the loss of pestcontrol from ongoing bat declines at more than $22bn in lost agricultural productivity. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the loss of the common species that will impact on people, not so much the rarer creatures because, by the very nature of their rarity, we\u2019re not reliant on them in such an obvious way,\u201d said Dr Nick Isaac, a macroecologist at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology in Oxfordshire. He says that recent work he and colleagues have been doing suggests that Britain\u2019s insects and other invertebrates are declining just as fast as vertebrates, with \u201cserious consequences for humanity\u201d. \u201cThe really interesting thing about this work is that we are learning that it\u2019s not just about the numbers of species going extinct, but the actual numbers in a population; that\u2019s the beginning of a fundamental shift in our understanding,\u201d he says. \nHe pointed to the fact that between 23 and 36% of all birds, mammals and amphibians used for food or medicine are now threatened with extinction. In many parts of the world, wild- animal food sources are a critical part of the diet, particularly for the poor. \nThe blame, most agree, sits with unsustainable human consumption damaging ecosystems, creating climate change and destroying habitats at a far faster rate than previously thought. But, this time, it\u2019s not just the \u201cbig, cuddly mammals\u201d we have to worry about losing but the smaller, less visible creatures upon which we depend \u2013 insects, creepy- crawlies and even worms. They might not be facing immediate extinction but a decline in their numbers will affect us all. \u201cWe are going to feel the impact of those losses. With the UK species, the pattern is much the same with invertebrates as it is with vertebrates. It\u2019s not as simplistic as 'fish die and people starve' \u2013 it\u2019s more complex,\u201d said Isaac. \nHumans, said TV naturalist Sir David Attenborough in 2013, are a \u201cplague on earth\u201d, but WWF claims there is still time to stop the rot. Its UK Chief Executive, David Nussbaum, said: \u201cThe scale of the destruction highlighted in this report should act as a wake-up call for us all. We all \u2013 politicians, business and people \u2013 have an interest, and a responsibility, to act to ensure we protect what we all value: a healthy future for people and nature. \n\u201cHumans are cutting down trees more quickly than they can regrow, harvesting more fish than the oceans can restock, pumping water from our rivers and aquifers faster than rainfall can replenish them and emitting more carbon than the oceans and forests can absorb,\u201d he said."}
