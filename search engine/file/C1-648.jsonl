He has been able to cope with the stigma of being HIV positive \u2013 widespread in Liberia \u2013 and he was able to access antiretroviral medication, provided by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and distributed by the Liberian government. But King and his family of six children could not get the right food to eat. A subsistence farmer, he grew vegetables and bought rice. \nBut meat and fish \u2013 expensive, luxury products in Liberian markets but essential sources of protein \u2013 remained elusive. \u201cSubsistence farming allowed us to survive, but we had so many problems,\u201d said King. \u201cWe could not get any protein, and we were not getting the nutrients we needed to sustain ourselves.\u201d Pate K Chon, a counsellor who works with HIV sufferers in Liberia, provided an unlikely solution. Since watching a documentary about a fish farm in Thailand several years earlier, she had thought of setting up a similar project in Liberia, enabling HIV sufferers to have work and also access a stable source of protein. \n\u201cI saw this film about fish in a cement pool and I thought it was a good idea,\u201d said Chon, herself diagnosed with HIV in 1992. \u201cSo many of the people I work with don\u2019t have the means to have a balanced protein diet and fish is such a clean source of protein \u2013 it doesn\u2019t cause health problems like other sources, and it is something we can farm.\u201d \nChon, founder of a faith-based NGO, began building a pool in which to farm fish. In June 2012, Chon met John Sheehy, a 'strategic philanthropist' and founder of consultancy Emerging Business Lab, who raised money for the non-profit fish farm in the northeast of Monrovia, Liberia\u2019s capital, and set about learning aquaculture, doing an online course through Cornell University and speaking to other fish farmers in Africa. \n\u201cI raised the money and built the farm, learned the proper tank layout and water flow system,\u201d said Sheehy. \u201cA lot of my knowledge was self-taught, and now I would love to be able to write a manual and share it with other people,\u201d he added. \nThe project has now grown into the Grow2Feed Liberia Fish Farm, with 12 tanks, which, when fully stocked, will each have 5,000 fish \u2013 providing up to 200,000 fish per year, serving a community of 1,200 predominantly HIV-positive people, including King and his family. \nIn addition to the fish, waste from the tanks is collected and used to irrigate crops, also providing food and income for the community, made up of 503 women, 206 men and 346 children. \n\u201cThe members of the community live near the farm, and have agreed to be part of the co-operative,\u201d said Sheehy. \u201cMany work on the farm, or tending the crops, and what they get in return \u2013 when the fish are fully grown after 90 days \u2013 is fish. They can use those fish to feed themselves and to sell in the market so that they get money to buy other staple items. \n\u201cThe fish farm gives these people with HIV a way of getting back into society \u2013 now they are bartering and trading with people in the market every week.\u201d \nAccording to Liberia\u2019s demographic health survey, 1.5% of Liberia\u2019s 3.5 million people are HIV positive, with 60% of those women or girls. Stigma and discrimination still surround the illness, and have led to around half of all cases in the country going untreated. \nGood nutrition is particularly important for people with HIV. Research has shown they need much higher levels of protein to prevent their health from deteriorating and to allow healthy growth. \u201cNutrition is one of the key things if you are taking antiretroviral drugs,\u201d said Chon. \u201cThe drugs are toxic and, if you don\u2019t have food to eat, they can make you very ill. But food in Liberia is very expensive. We buy expensive imported rice, even though we should be growing it ourselves and fish is difficult for most people to afford.\u201d \nSheehy says Grow2Feed is the first co-operative fish farm in Liberia to operate for the benefit of an HIV-positive community. The project has attracted the interest of the Liberian government, and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, which has worked with Grow2Feed to provide training, will also support teaching at the University of Liberia. \nFish farming experts say the practice has huge potential in Africa. \n\u201cFish farming is absolutely viable in Africa,\u201d said Paul White, owner of the HydroFish fish farm in Ivory Coast, which produces 3,000 tonnes of fish each year. \u201cA lot of the fish on the market comes from China and is imported frozen. It is of a quality that could never enter Europe or America. There has been a serious lack of investment and a lack of know-how in fish production. It is all coming to the forefront now,\u201d he added. \nSome critics are sceptical of farmed fish, citing inbred fish and high levels of toxins. But Sheehy said good practice mitigated these problems. \u201cA lot of farmed fish is inbred, which does cause problems, but we are using a process with local fish sourced in Liberia, not fish from another region,\u201d said Sheehy. \u201cThat means we can continue using local fish to bring in new broodstock. \u201cAnd we are not using lakes that are cornered off, where the fish absorb all the toxins in the lake. We can control the environment using the tanks, and we test the water and monitor it constantly.\u201d \nSheehy hopes to replicate the model throughout Liberia and the region. \u201cA rice-growing co-op in Sierra Leone asked us if we could do this on our property so that they can feed their workers and we have had interest from Nigeria and Central America,\u201d said Sheehy. \u201cBut we operate 100% non-profit and we will never lose our social justice aspect.\u201d"}
