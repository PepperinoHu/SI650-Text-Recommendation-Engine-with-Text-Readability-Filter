But, on Tuesday 8th April, 2014, she described the extraordinary moment when she received a message in a bottle, 101 years after he had lobbed it into the Baltic Sea. Thought to be the world\u2019s oldest message in a bottle, it was presented to Erdmann by the museum that is now exhibiting it in Germany. \n\u201cIt was very surprising,\u201d Erdmann, 62, said, recalling how she found out about the bottle. \u201cA man stood at my door and told me he had post from my grandfather. He then told me that a message in a bottle had been found and that the name that was on the card was that of my grandfather.\u201d Her visitor was a genealogical researcher who had managed to track her down in Berlin after the letter was given to the International Maritime Museum in the northern port city of Hamburg. \nThe brown beer bottle, which had been in the water for 101 years, was found in the catch of Konrad Fischer, a fisherman, who had been out in the Baltic Sea off the northern city of Kiel. Holger von Neuhoff, curator for ocean and science at the museum, said this bottled message was the oldest he had come across. \u201cThere are documents that have been found without the bottle that are older and are in the museum,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, with the bottle and the document, this is certainly the oldest at the moment. It is in extremely good condition.\u201d \nResearchers believe Erdmann\u2019s grandfather, Richard Platz, threw the bottle in the sea while on a hike with a nature appreciation group in 1913. He was 20 years old at the time. \nMuch of the postcard was indecipherable, although the address in Berlin on the front of the card was legible, as was the author\u2019s polite request that the note be sent by the finder to his home address. \n\u201cHe also included two stamps from that time that were also in the bottle, so the finder would not incur a cost,\u201d Erdmann said. \u201cBut he did not think it would take 101 years.\u201d \nShe said she was moved by the arrival of the message, although she had not known her grandfather because he died, at the age of 54, six years before she was born. \n\u201cI knew very little about my grandfather, but I found out that he was a writer who was very open-minded, and believed in freedom and that everyone should respect each other,\u201d she said. \u201cHe did a lot for the young and later travelled with his wife and two daughters. It was wonderful because I could see where my roots came from.\u201d \nLike her grandfather, Erdmann said, she also liked culture and travelling around the world. She described herself as open-minded, too. \u201cWhat he taught his two daughters, my mother taught me and I have then given to my sons,\u201d she said. Despite her joy at receiving the bottled message, she said that she hoped others would not repeat what her grandfather had done and throw bottles with messages into the sea. \u201cToday, the sea is so full of so many bottles and rubbish that more shouldn\u2019t be thrown in there,\u201d she said. \nThe message and the bottle will be on display at Hamburg\u2019s Maritime Museum until the beginning of May 2014, after which experts will attempt to decipher the rest of the text. It is not clear what will then happen to the bottle, but Erdmann hopes it will stay at the museum. \n\u201cWe want to make a few photos available to put with the bottle and give it a face, so visitors can see the young man who threw the bottle into the water,\u201d she said."}
