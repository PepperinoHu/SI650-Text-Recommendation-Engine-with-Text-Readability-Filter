{"id": "C2-1335", "contents": "\ufeffWhen you see the word Amazon, what\u2019s the first thing that springs to mind \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest forest, the longest river or the largest internet retailer \u2013 and which do you consider most important? \nThese questions have risen to the fore in an arcane, but hugely important, debate about how to redraw the boundaries of the internet. Brazil and Peru have lodged objections to a bid made by the US e-commerce giant for a prime new piece of cyberspace: \u201c.amazon\u201d. \nThe Seattle-based company has applied for its brand to be a top-level domain name (currently \u201c.com\u201d), but the South American governments argue this would prevent the use of this internet address for environmental protection, the promotion of indigenous rights and other public interest uses. \nAlong with dozens of other disputed claims to names, including \u201c.patagonia\u201d and \u201c.shangrila \u201d, the issue cuts to the heart of debates about the purpose and governance of the internet. \nUntil now, the differences between commercial, governmental and other types of identity were easily distinguished in every internet address by \u201c.com\u201d, \u201c.gov\u201d and 20 other categories. \nBut these categories \u2013 or generic top-level domains (gTLDs) as they are technically known \u2013 are about to undergo the biggest expansion since the start of the worldwide web. \nThe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) \u2013 a US-based non-profit organization that plays a key role in cyberspace governance \u2013 has received bids (each reportedly worth almost $200,000) for hundreds of new gTLDs to add to the existing 22. \nAmazon has applied for dozens of new domains, including \u201c.shop \u201d, \u201c.song\u201d, \u201c.book\u201d and \u201c.kindle . But its most contentious application is for its own brand. \nBrazil and Peru have called for the \u201c.amazon\u201d application to be withdrawn, saying a private company should not be assigned a name that denotes an important geographical area that spans their territories and is also used for certain regions and cross-border organizations. \u201cAllowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to reinforce their brand strategy or to profit from the meaning of these names does not serve, in our view, the public interest,\u201d the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said. \nBrazil said its views were endorsed last month by other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela). \nDozens of other protests have also been registered over proposed top-level domains that take geographical, cultural or contested brand names. \nArgentina has lodged an expression of its unhappiness that the US outdoor clothing retailer, Patagonia, is claiming a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty that also has its own parliament. \u201cArgentina rejects the \u201c.patagonia\u201d request for a new generic top-level domain,\u201d the government notes in an appeal. \u201cPatagonia is a relevant region for the country\u2019s economy because it has oil, fishing, mining and agriculture resources. It is also a region with a vibrant local community and it is a major tourist destination.\u201d \nLess convincingly, China has disputed the domain \u201c.shangrila\u201d, which is proposed by a hotel group of the same name. The authorities in Beijing say the \u201cshangri-la\u201d label belongs to a region in Yunnan province, although it was only renamed as such in 2001 (long after the hotel group was formed) so that the local community could cash in on the fame of the fictional paradise depicted in the novel, Lost Horizon, by British author James Hilton. \nAt a conference in April in Beijing, ICANN\u2019s Governmental Advisory Committee \u2013 the primary voice of national governments within the institution \u2013 recommended a freeze on disputed proposals. They are expected to be discussed again at a meeting in Durban in July. The first approved domain names should be in use before the end of 2013."}
