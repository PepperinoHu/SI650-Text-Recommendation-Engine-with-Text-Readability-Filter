There\u2019s too many of them and there are not enough big acts to headline them. That is a big, big problem in our industry. And, we are not producing a new generation of these kind of acts \u2013 the likes of the Rolling Stones, Muse, even the Arctic Monkeys \u2013 that can headline.\u201d \nThere were about 900 music festival events in the UK between May and September 2014, he said, and there is no way they can all continue. \u201cMusic festivals have probably run their course. What is going to happen is a growth in events where it isn\u2019t just music but, like this one, with poetry or books or magic shows. There will be lots of small combination festivals that give something extra \u2013 not people standing around in a massive great field unable to go to the toilet because they might miss the band.\u201d \nClearly, the way music is being delivered has changed, he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t seem to want to listen to a body of work, an album, any more. And, most rock bands built a reputation on a body of work \u2013 they might take three albums to really hone their art, to become great, but young people don\u2019t want that. They home in on a track, a sound, then, ping, off again to the next one. Pop pervades, not that there\u2019s anything wrong with pop. I think it will come round again but it will take time.\u201d \nGoldsmith, 69, also revealed that he has teamed up with Robin de Levita, the Dutch producer of the Who\u2019s 1970s rock musical Tommy, at a new 1,100-seat theatre in Wembley, which is due to be finished in time for the first stage adaptation of the phenomenally successful teen book and movie series The Hunger Games in June 2016. \nDe Levita would, said Goldsmith, be bringing his experimental SceneAround concept to London \u2013 theatre that puts the audience seating on a turntable that rotates round a series of scenes built around its circumference, accompanied by projections on panel screens. The concept was pioneered in an aircraft hangar outside Amsterdam and has proved hugely successful. \nGoldsmith, who is already planning to bring a production of the Anne Frank story to the as-yet-unnamed venue, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a whole completely different way of producing shows.\u201d \nDuring his Hay appearance, the impresario also revealed some of the \u201caccess-all-areas\u201d secrets from his long career in the music industry, talking about Keith Moon putting dynamite down a Sydney hotel room toilet in an effort to unblock it and witnessing the paralysing stage fright that gripped John Lennon just before an appearance at Madison Square Garden in 1974 and led to him being dragged, vomiting, out of his dressing room and shoved out on stage. \u201cIt\u2019s the most bizarre thing, really, how common that is among artists. It\u2019s odd how stricken with fear they\u2019ll get but, as soon as the first chord is hit, they\u2019re fine,\u201d he said. \nHe also laid to rest a long-running rock\u2019n\u2019 roll mystery: why Elvis Presley never performed outside North America. Presley\u2019s long-time manager, Colonel Tom Parker, admitted to him over tea, he said, that the real reason why Goldsmith\u2019s attempts to bring the singer to London had failed was Parker\u2019s own uncertain immigration status. \n\u201cHe explained that it was because he was an illegal Dutch immigrant. He didn\u2019t want to risk leaving the US \u2013 it was him, not Elvis,\u201d said Goldsmith. \nAnd, his ultimate rock\u2019n\u2019 roll performer? \u201cFreddie Mercury had to be our most powerful stage performer, the best live performer we\u2019ve ever had. At Live Aid, he went out and saw that audience and just grabbed it.\u201d \nBut, the next Queen was still far from being formed, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not producing a new generation of this kind of act. Coldplay is probably the last one to come up and that was ten years ago. There isn\u2019t much out there that looks like it is forming the next generation of heritage artists. \n\u201cSo, with no big acts to headline, there are no big shows. Glastonbury has got to the point where it can\u2019t find any more big acts and that\u2019s the pinnacle of the festivals. They are really over.\u201d"}
