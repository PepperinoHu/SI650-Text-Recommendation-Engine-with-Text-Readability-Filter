That was terrible!\nThat day I was going to walk home with him, but I decided to go to the library.\nI can't believe it. Is he okay?\nHe broke some bones, but other than that, he is okay.\nOh, great! So, why are you collecting money for him?\nThe hospital bills are sort of steep. His parents can't afford it.\nOh, wow! Well, here is my last $10. Please send my best to Chris.\nThank you. Every dollar counts.\nBless your heart for helping him out."}
