It's behind the door near the light switches.\nOpen all the blinds and turn on the lights.\nPlease don't forget to start the coffee machine so your colleagues have fresh coffee for when they arrive.\nAt 8.15 a.m., watch out for the fresh deliveries at the back door. They usually arrive at that time.\nPay attention to the order list and what is actually delivered.\nRemember not to sign for anything that isn't in the delivery as there are often items missing.\nCheck the answer phone and shop email account for any new messages.\nLeave the heating and the air conditioning alone. They are on an automatic timer. So please, don't go near the control panels.\nFinally, you need to finish everything above before 8.45 a.m. and open the shop at 9 a.m. There is a red logbook under the counter. Make sure you sign it for each day when you have completed all points on this checklist. Make a note of any issues.\nIf you have any problems, call your supervisor or the 24-hour support line number below."}
