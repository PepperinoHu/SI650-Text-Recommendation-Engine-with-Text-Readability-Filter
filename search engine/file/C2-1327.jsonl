The 140,000 ticket-holders are also being urged to bring reusable bottles that they can fill at 400 drinking- water taps dotted across the site. \nLucy Smith, Glastonbury\u2019s green issues organizer, said: \u201cWe have amazing water quality in the UK but everyone is obsessed with drinking bottled water.\u201d \nShe said the initiative precedes a plan for Glastonbury 2015 to replace all plastic beer glasses and cutlery with reusable items in an attempt to eradicate the legacy of plastic waste from the huge rural site. \nEnvironmentalists estimate that 150 million tonnes of plastic waste currently litters the planet and oceans, poisoning ecosystems and killing wildlife. \nUltimately, festival organizers hope to make Glastonbury the world\u2019s greenest greenfield festival, emulating America\u2019s Burning Man festival in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, which is a \u201cleave-no-trace\u201d event, where people have to take away all that they bring. \nGlastonbury revellers are also being urged to travel to the site on public transport or try car-sharing with friends. \u201cWe want to be as sustainable as we can. We do everything we can, but coping with the litter of 140,000 people is a challenge. We can\u2019t put bins everywhere,\u201d added Smith. \nCampaigners say that plastic water bottles can take hundreds or even thousands of years to completely biodegrade, with their manufacture exacerbating their negative ecological impact. Millions of barrels of oil are used in the manufacture of plastic bottles and the transportation of mineral water across the planet produces even more carbon emissions. \nOverall, an estimated 13 billion plastic water bottles are sold in the UK every year, yet just one in five is said to be recycled. \nSmith said that, instead of buying bottled water, festival-goers should take advantage of the water on tap, which is being drawn from huge underground reservoirs, instead of old-fashioned water tanks that provided heavily chlorinated drinking water. The charity WaterAid will also set up water kiosks around the site, stocking reusable bottles and cups, and offering free refills. In 2015, the kiosks \u2013 modelled on those found in Africa \u2013 will double as DJ booths at night. \nOrganizers say that almost half of all the rubbish left on site was recycled in 2013 and add that there will be 15,000 bins for recycling across the festival grounds in 2014. \nDespite its growing eco-credentials, critics continue to snipe at Glastonbury, accusing it of becoming increasingly corporate in tone. The latest critic, Iron Maiden\u2019s Bruce Dickinson, has vowed never to bring his band to Glastonbury Festival after dismissing it as \u201cthe most bourgeois thing on the planet\u201d. \nThe weather forecast for Glastonbury was positive, with the festival due to be sunny and dry, experts ruling out a repeat of 1985, the festival\u2019s windiest year; 1997, its muddiest; and 2005, known as the \u201cyear of thunder\u201d."}
