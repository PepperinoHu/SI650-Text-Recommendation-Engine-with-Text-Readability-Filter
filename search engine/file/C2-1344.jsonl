Having disappointed many supporters in his first term, he is looking now to establish a legacy that will transform him from a middling president into a great one. \nAs well as overseeing what he hopes will be continued economic recovery, he hopes to address issues ranging from immigration reform to investment in education and climate change, and, in foreign policy, from Iran to Israel-Palestine. \nAs well as comfortably winning more than the required 270 electoral college votes, he also secured a higher share of the popular vote. \nBoehner, in a statement, sounded conciliatory. He cited \u201cthe need for both parties to find common ground and take steps together to help our economy grow and create jobs, which is critical to solving our debt\u201d. Obama is reported to have phoned Boehner to begin negotiation. \nReid, so often at odds with Boehner, also sounded conciliatory, saying: \u201cI look at the challenges that we have ahead of us and I reach out to my Republican colleagues in the Senate and the House. Let\u2019s come together. We know what the issues are; let\u2019s solve them.\u201d \nObama, in an initially off-the-record interview during the campaign, expressed optimism of a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with the Republicans, one that eluded him in 2011. The trouble will come when talks move to detail, with the Republicans wanting to protect military spending while the Democrats seek cuts. Obama has called for tax increases on households earning more than $250,000; Boehner has rejected any tax increases. \nShares dropped on the Dow in anticipation of continued gridlock. By lunchtime, all the major US markets were down over 300 points. \nThe new House, which will be formed in January, will look much like the existing one, which has a huge Republican majority. The Senate too remained little changed, with the Democrats retaining their slim majority, gaining three and losing one. \nIn the presidential race, Romney won only one of the swing states, North Carolina, while Obama held New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, Wisconsin, Nevada, Iowa and Colorado. \nIn his victory speech in Chicago, Obama referred to the long queues to vote and said there was a need for electoral reform. \nHe returned to the soaring rhetoric that was his trademark during the 2008 election but which he dispensed with in 2012. Amid the disillusionment with his presidency and the tough economic conditions, his campaign team decided it was inappropriate. \nBut having won, he returned to famous lines from earlier speeches, reprising once again his 2008 slogan about \u201chope\u201d. \nStepping up to the lectern to the upbeat sounds of Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cSigned, Sealed, Delivered, I\u2019m Yours,\u201d Obama told the ecstatic crowd of supporters: \u201cTonight in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back. And we know in our hearts that for the United States of America the best is yet to come.\u201d In a speech that lasted more than 25 minutes, after paying emotional tribute to his wife, Michelle, and his daughters, Malia and Sasha \u2013 as well as to his Vice-President, Joe Biden \u2013 Obama returned to the message that first brought him to national attention. \n\u201cWe are not as divided as our politics suggests,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not as cynical as the pundits believe. We are greater than the sum of our individual ambitions, and we remain more than a collection of red states and blue states. We are, and forever will be, the United States of America.\u201d \nObama made clear he had an agenda in mind for his second term, citing changes in the tax code, immigration reform and, as he put it, an America \u201cthat isn\u2019t threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet\u201d. \nShortly beforehand, Romney had phoned the President to concede. In a gracious concession speech in Boston, Romney told his supporters: \u201cThe nation, as you know, is at a critical point. At a time like this, we can\u2019t risk partisan bickering and political posturing. Our leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the people\u2019s work.\u201d \nHe continued: \u201cThis is a time for great challenges for America and I pray the President will be successful in guiding our nation.\u201d \nThe campaign almost throughout has been a referendum on Obama. Although there was widespread disillusionment with the slow pace of economy recovery and a high unemployment level, Americans decided to stick with him. \nHistorically, it would have been a disappointment for African Americans and many white liberals if the first black presidency had ended in failure, halted prematurely."}
