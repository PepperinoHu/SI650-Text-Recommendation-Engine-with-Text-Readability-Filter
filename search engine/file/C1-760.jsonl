What made Nelson Mandela great was precisely what made him human. We saw in him what we seek in ourselves. \n\u201cFellow South Africans, Nelson Mandela brought us together and it is together that we will bid him farewell.\u201d \nZuma announced that Mandela would receive a state funeral and ordered that flags fly at half-mast. \nArchbishop Desmond Tutu led a memorial service in Cape Town, where he called for South Africa to become as a nation what Mandela had been as a man. \nBarack Obama led tributes from world leaders, referring to Mandela by his clan name \u2013 Madiba. The US president said: \u201cThrough his fierce dignity and unbending will to sacrifice his own freedom for the freedom of others, Madiba transformed South Africa \u2013 and moved all of us. \n\u201cHis journey from a prisoner to a president embodied the promise that human beings \u2013 and countries \u2013 can change for the better. His commitment to transfer power and reconcile with those who jailed him set an example that all humanity should aspire to, whether in the lives of nations or our own personal lives.\u201d \nUK prime minister David Cameron said, \u201cA great light has gone out in the world,\u201d and described Mandela as \u201ca hero of our time\u201d. \nFW de Klerk \u2013 the South African president who freed Mandela, shared the Nobel Peace Prize with him in 1993 and paved the way for him to become South Africa\u2019s first post-apartheid head of state \u2013 said the news was deeply saddening for South Africa and the world. \n\u201cHe lived reconciliation. He was a great unifier,\u201d de Klerk said. \nPeople gathered in the streets of South Africa to celebrate Mandela\u2019s life. \nIn Soweto, people gathered to sing and dance near the house where he once lived. They formed a circle in the middle of Vilakazi Street and sang songs from the anti-apartheid struggle. Some people were draped in South African flags and the green, yellow and black colours of Mandela\u2019s party, the African National Congress (ANC). Mandela\u2019s death sends South Africa deep into mourning and self-reflection, nearly 20 years after he led the country from racial apartheid to inclusive democracy. \nBut his passing will also be keenly felt by people around the world, who revered Mandela as one of history\u2019s last great statesmen, and a moral paragon comparable with Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Martin Luther King. It was his act of forgiveness, after spending 27 years in prison, 18 of them on Robben Island, that will assure his place in history. With South Africa facing possible civil war, Mandela sought reconciliation with the white minority to build a new democracy. \nHe led the ANC to victory in the country\u2019s first multiracial election in 1994. He then voluntarily stepped down after one term. \nBorn Rolihlahla Dalibhunga in a small village in the Eastern Cape on 18 July, 1918, Mandela was given his English name, Nelson, by a teacher at his school. \nHe joined the ANC in 1943 and became a co-founder of its youth league. In 1952, he started South Africa\u2019s first black law firm with his partner, Oliver Tambo. \nMandela was a charming, charismatic figure with a passion for boxing and an eye for women. He once said: \u201cI can\u2019t help it if the ladies take note of me. I am not going to protest.\u201d \nWhen the ANC was banned in 1960, Mandela went underground. After the Sharpeville massacre, in which 69 black protesters were shot dead by police, he took the difficult decision to launch an armed struggle. He was arrested and eventually charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government. \nConducting his own defence in the Rivonia trial in 1964, he said: \u201cI have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. \n\u201cIt is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But, if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.\u201d \nHe escaped the death penalty but was sentenced to life in prison, a huge blow to the ANC, which had to regroup to continue the struggle. But unrest grew in townships and international pressure on the apartheid regime slowly tightened. \nFinally, in 1990, FW de Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and Mandela was released from prison amid scenes of jubilation witnessed around the world. \nHis presidency rode a wave of tremendous global goodwill but was not without its difficulties. After leaving frontline politics in 1999, he admitted he should have moved sooner against the spread of HIV and Aids in South Africa. \nArchbishop Desmond Tutu, who headed the truth and reconciliation committee after the fall of apartheid, said: \u201cHe transcended race and class in his personal actions, through his warmth and through his willingness to listen and to empathize with others. And he restored others\u2019 faith in Africa and Africans.\u201d \nMandela continued to make occasional appearances at ANC events and attended the inauguration of the current president, Jacob Zuma. His 91st birthday was marked by the first annual \u201cMandela Day\u201d in his honour. \nMarried three times, he had six children, 17 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren."}
