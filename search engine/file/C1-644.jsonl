Unfortunately, six Ikea forks, a Chinese guitar and unsourced wall paint stopped him being declared a 100% economic patriot, but nobody is perfect. \nCarle, 26, set out, in 2013, to see if it was possible to live using only French-made products for ten months as part of a television documentary. \nThe idea was triggered by the Minister for Economic Renewal Arnaud Montebourg\u2019s call for the public to buy French to save the country\u2019s industrial production sector. \nThe experiment cost Carle his smartphone, television, refrigerator (all made in China); his spectacles (Italian); his underpants (Moroccan); morning coffee (Guatemalan) and his adored David Bowie music (British). \nFortunately, his long-suffering girlfriend, Ana\u00efs, and cat, Loon, (both French) stuck with him. \n\u201cPoliticians say all sorts of things and expect us to go along with it. I wanted to see if it was possible and feasible to do what the minister was asking us to do; to hold him to account for his words,\u201d Carle told the Guardian over a non-French coffee in a Parisian caf\u00e9 after finishing his documentary. \nHe set just three rules: eat only foods produced in France, eliminate contact with foreign-made goods and do so on \u20ac1,800 a month (above the minimum wage of \u20ac1,430 to cover the extra expense of living in Paris). \nThe journalist was shocked to find out at the start of the experiment that only 4.5% of the contents of his flat were made nationally \u2013 and that the rest would have to go, including the lightbulbs (China) and green beans (Kenya). \nThe removal men left his home almost bare. \nLeft without a refrigerator (none are made in France) or nail clippers, he was forced to chill his food on the window ledge and saw at his toenails with a penknife. \nHis foreign-made clothes, down to his underwear, were replaced with more expensive alternatives: French-produced underpants (\u20ac26), socks (\u20ac9), polo shirt (\u20ac75), espadrille sandals ( \u20ac26), but no jeans as none are produced in France. \nDuring the experiment, Carle scoured supermarket shelves for 100% French-made products, learned to cook seasonal fruit and vegetables grown in France, proudly brushed his teeth with the last toothbrush made in France by a company in Picardie employing 29 people and hand-washed his smalls until he found the last French-made washing machine (which, being top opening, would not fit under the kitchen counter). \nGoing out with friends was problematic \u2013 no American films, no Belgian beer, no sushi or pizza. Staying home, with no sofa for the first few months and no television, meant listening to crooner Michel Sardou and reading French novels. French wine was, of course, allowed and French-Canadian singer C\u00e9line Dion, but not, according to his advisers, French bands such as Daft Punk, who sing in English. \nUnable to use his British-made bicycle or even a French car after discovering the only affordable Peugeot, Renault and Citro\u00ebn models are mostly made overseas, he invested in a fug-emitting orange Mobylette moped. \nThe last things to go were the computer, replaced by a Qooq, a recipe tablet that connects \u2013 slowly \u2013 to the internet and the iPhone, swapped for an old Sagem mobile. \nThe documentary shows Carle \u2013 realizing he is addicted to his iPhone \u2013 smashing it with a brand-new French-made Tefal saucepan, while his girlfriend shrieks: \u201cAre you crazy? Those are new pans!\u201d \nCarle tells viewers his aim is to \u201csave the French economy. After all, I like Mission Impossible\u201d. He admits the experiment was part serious and part jest. At one point, he consults a French language expert to check if he should be using \u201ccool\u201d and other Anglicisms \u2013 he was advised to swap it for the nearest French equivalent: \u201cchouette\u201d. \nOn discovering France makes no refrigerators (apart from wine coolers) or televisions, but is big in aeroplane seats and windmills, he sighs and says: \u201cGreat. Nothing that will fit into my apartment.\u201d \nAt the end of the experiment, Carle takes out a bank loan to refurnish his home and clothe himself. A special \u201cauditor\u201d declares him 96.9% \u201cmade in France\u201d and Montebourg visits to present him with a medal. \nCarle\u2019s conclusion: \u201cIt\u2019s not entirely possible or even desirable to live 100% made in France, particularly in terms of new technology. But that wasn\u2019t the point. \n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t about French nationalism or patriotism. It was trying to show that we should reflect about the way we consume and make different choices, and that applies in all countries. If we want to save jobs and industries, wherever we are, we might think about supporting them. \n\u201cA T-shirt is more expensive in France but I can be sure it has been produced by workers who are correctly paid and have good working conditions. I cannot be sure about a cheaper T-shirt produced in Asia or Morocco.\u201d \nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s hypocrisy to go around blaming capitalists for a country\u2019s economic decline when people could be doing more as consumers.\u201d \nCarle says he hopes to continue supporting French industry and producers, but not 100%. \u201cIt is a full-time job just finding the stuff,\u201d he said. \nThe first thing he did when the experiment ended was invite his friends around for the evening to enjoy \u201ca plate of cheese and listen to the David Bowie album Aladdin Sane\u201d. \n\u201cIt was difficult not being able to invite people around because there was nowhere to sit ... but I\u2019d choose the Bowie over a sofa any day.\u201d"}
