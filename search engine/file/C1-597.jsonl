{"id": "C1-597", "contents": "\ufeffA thick crust of bird droppings is piled on the gilded balustrade of one of Britain\u2019s most expensive properties. Pigeon skeletons lie among shattered mirrors and water streams through broken cornicing. This is The Towers, a \u00a330m palace in \u201cBillionaires\u2019 Row\u201d in north London, whose spectacular ruin has been kept secret until now. \nIt is one of ten mansions in the middle of The Bishops Avenue \u2013 the heart of London\u2019s spiralling property market \u2013 that have stood almost entirely vacant since they were bought a quarter of a century ago, it is believed on behalf of members of the Saudi Arabian royal family. Their Grecian columns are cracking into pieces and mosaic-tiled swimming pools are filled with rubble. Nature has taken over to the extent that owls have moved in. \nIt is a desolate scene repeated up and down the supposedly prestigious avenue that Lloyds Bank has calculated is the second most expensive street in Britain. While more and more people struggle to get on to London\u2019s property ladder as house prices rise at 11.2% a year, 16 mansions on the most expensive stretch of The Bishops Avenue are sitting empty, many behind padlocked gates, with their windows shuttered with steel grilles and overgrown grounds patrolled by guard dogs. \nAcross the street stands another derelict mansion, worth \u00a318m, with smashed windows and walls coated in anti-climb paint. Metal grilles block the windows of another, which has been sold for \u00a320m. \nBut that doesn\u2019t stop the prices going up. Dryades, a mansion until recently owned by a Pakistani politician, sold for \u00a312m in 2007 and is believed to be worth about \u00a330m today. Heath Lodge, the scene of the 1984 murder, by silver bullet, of fashion tycoon Aristos Constantinou, is worth \u00a313m today, after having been sold in the late 1970s for \u00a3400,000. \nThe dereliction can be agonizing for people struggling to keep a roof above their heads in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities. One security guard working on the avenue said it was exasperating to see so many tens of thousands of square feet of property \u2013 enough to house dozens of people \u2013 falling apart. \nRoyals flushed with oil wealth from Nigeria and Saudi Arabia were among the first to come to this curving road near Hampstead Heath. Iranians fled here after the fall of the shah. Now, Chinese house hunters are following Russians and Kazakhs who have spent millions securing an address estate agents tell them is as world famous as the Champs Elys\u00e9es and Rodeo Drive. Recently, two mansions have been on sale for \u00a365m and \u00a338m, promising endless Italian marble, leather-padded lifts and luxury panic rooms. \nHowever, in the grounds of the empty mansions, stone fountains crumble and lawns have become bogs. Inside one, water drips through a huge crystal chandelier onto a thick carpet rotting under sections of collapsed ceiling. Moss grows through shattered bricks and mirrored tiles are scattered across a bathroom. The swimming pool is filled with a foot of brackish water and has flowers growing through its tiles. Wooden slats bulge away from the sauna. \nBut it is the wreck of The Towers, a grand mansion set among acres of hornbeams, oaks and limes, that is most dramatic, with its huge, high-ceiling halls occupied by pigeons and its walls turned bright green by algae as water pours through three storeys and plinks into a vast, empty, basement swimming pool. Unopened wooden crates marked \u201cbullet- proof glass\u201d reveal the security fears of the previous owners. \nToday, very few people live on The Bishops Avenue full time. A security guard patrolling the pavement outside one mansion said that the owners were not there. Another, outside Royal Mansion, declined to say if anyone was home, while a member of staff at another mansion simply warned the Guardian about the guard dogs. Magdy Adib Ishak-Hannah, an Egyptian-born private healthcare mogul, whose personal wealth is \u00a345m, said he was in the minority of permanent residents. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a neighbourly place, where you can chat over the fence,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be honest, I have never seen what my neighbours look like. Next door, a Saudi princess spent \u00a335m on a new house and I\u2019ve never seen her. There are about three houses that are lived in 24/7 and half of the properties are occupied three to six months a year. The other half, who knows if they come or not?\u201d \nThe multimillion-pound wrecks are evidence of a property culture in which the world\u2019s richest people see British property as investments. One Hyde Park, a block of apartments in Knightsbridge, is another example where more than half the flats are registered with the council as empty or second homes. \nNevertheless, the talk on the avenue is about building \u00a35m apartments, instead of \u00a350m mansions, in an effort to draw people back. \nAnil Varma, a local property developer, has decided to rebuild one of the most valuable sites on the avenue as a collection of 20 apartments with a concierge, maid service, 25-metre pool, spa and cinema. \n\u201cIf you build a big house and try and sell for \u00a330m to \u00a340m, it won\u2019t sell,\u201d he said. \u201cLocals won\u2019t buy and so you have to bring in overseas buyers.\u201d \nBut the prospect of the avenue\u2019s empty property being used to help solve the housing crisis remains distant. Andrew Harper, a local Conservative councillor, laughed when asked whether some of the derelict housing could become affordable homes. He said the land price would be prohibitive. \n\u201cVery wealthy people own property there,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes they live in them and sometimes they don\u2019t.\u201d"}
