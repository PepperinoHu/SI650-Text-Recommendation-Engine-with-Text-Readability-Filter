Recently, Dong Nguyen, the designer of the mobile game Flappy Bird, pulled it from app stores, saying its success \u2013 it had been downloaded more than 50 million times, and was making him around \u00a330,000 in advertising revenue each day \u2013 had ruined his simple life. He took to his Twitter account to say: \u201cI cannot take this anymore.\u201d \nOK, so regretting making Flappy Bird isn\u2019t quite the same as regretting making a ri\ufb02e, but Nguyen is just the latest in a long line of inventors who wish they hadn\u2019t created a monster. \n2 The labradoodle \nThe labradoodle isn\u2019t a monster \u2013 it\u2019s adorable, obviously. But what\u2019s monstrous is the way crossbreed dogs have been bred and marketed since the labradoodle\u2019s inventor, Wally Conron, \ufb01rst created the breed in the 1980s. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of damage,\u201d he told the Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019ve created a lot of problems. There are a lot of unhealthy and abandoned dogs out there.\u201d Conron came up with the labradoodle when he was working for the Royal Guide Dog Association of Australia to provide a dog for a blind woman whose husband was allergic to dog hair. What he didn\u2019t expect was that the labradoodle \u2013 and its other poodle-cross variants, many of which have health problems \u2013 would become so popular. \n3 The AK-47 \nSix months before his death in December 2013, Mikhail Kalashnikov, the designer of the assault ri\ufb02e, wrote to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church: \u201cMy spiritual torment is unbearable. One and the same question: if my ri \ufb02 e killed people, does that mean that I, Mikhail Kalashnikov, 93 years of age, the son of a peasant, Christian and Orthodox by faith, am responsible for people\u2019s deaths, even if they were enemies?\u201d \n4 Electronic tagging \nThe electronic tag was originally conceived in the 1960s as a way of tracking former prisoners\u2019 attendance at schools and workplaces, and rewarding them for good behaviour. Its inventors, Bob Gable and his brother Kirkland, were later horri \ufb01 ed that the tag had become a form of control and punishment. \u201cIt\u2019s not pleasant,\u201d Kirkland Gable told the Guardian in 2010, \u201cbut I\u2019m not in control of the universe. I have to realize there are some things out of my control.\u201d \n5 Pepper spray \nAfter police sprayed peaceful protesters with pepper spray at a University of California campus in 2011, one of the scientists who helped develop it in the 80s denounced its use. \u201cI have never seen such an inappropriate and improper use of chemical agents,\u201d Kamran Loghman told The New York Times. \n6 The of\ufb01ce cubicle \nIn the late 60s, a new form of of\ufb01ce was launched, designed to give workers privacy and increase productivity by providing more work space. Instead, it became a way for companies to cram employees into tighter spaces, a visual shorthand for uniformity and soulless work. Its inventor, Bob Propst, said in 1997, \u201cthe cubiclizing of people in modern corporations is monolithic insanity.\u201d"}
