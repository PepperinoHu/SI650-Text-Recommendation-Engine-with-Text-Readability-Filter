Cancel takeoff plans ! as the two planes moved toward each other.\nThe pilot of the Lufthansa jet acknowledged as the plane rolled to a halt.\nLufthansa Flight 411, an Airbus 340 packed with 286 passengers and crew, was cleared for takeoff by air traffic control shortly before 7 p.m. Monday, according to a statement from Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen.\nEgyptAir Flight 986, a Boeing 777, was issued instructions to taxi from the ramp area to the airfield for departure.\nThe plane was instructed to turn onto another taxiway, but instead went straight, the statement said.\nA spokesman for EgyptAir said the flight was delayed 40 minutes because Lufthansa's departure was delayed.\nThe plane did not move until the tower issued clearance, spokesman Mohamed Rahma said.\nAfter a brief inspection at the gate, the Lufthansa flight continued on its flight to Munich, Germany, and arrived safely, according to Lufthansa spokesman Martin Riecken.\nThe FAA is currently investigating the incident.\nMohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report."}
