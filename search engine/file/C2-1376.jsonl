That is now thought unlikely by scientists, but average land and sea temperatures are expected to continue rising throughout this century, possibly reaching 4\u00b0C above present levels \u2013 enough to devastate crops and make life in many cities unbearably hot. \nAs temperatures climb and oceans warm, tropical and subtropical regions will face sharp changes in annual rainfall, says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, released in Stockholm and published online in September. \nEast Africa can expect to experience increased short rains, while west Africa should expect heavier monsoons. Burma, Bangladesh and India can expect stronger cyclones; elsewhere in southern Asia, heavier summer rains are anticipated. Indonesia may receive less rainfall between July and October, but the coastal regions around the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand can expect increased rainfall extremes when cyclones hit land. \n\u201cIt is virtually certain that, in the long term, global precipitation will change. High latitude countries, such as in Europe or North America, are expected to receive more rainfall, but many subtropical arid and semi-arid regions will likely experience less precipitation. Over wet tropical regions, extreme precipitation events will very likely be more intense and more frequent in a warmer world,\u201d said the report\u2019s authors. \nThey added: \u201cMonsoon onset dates are likely to become earlier or not to change much while monsoon withdrawal rates are very likely to delay, resulting in a lengthening of the season.\u201d \nScientists in developing countries and commentators have welcomed the report, which they said backed their own observations. \n\u201cThe IPCC makes the case that climate change is real and happening much more strongly than before. We are already seeing the effects of climate change in Bangladesh and across south Asia. It\u2019s not news to us. Most developing countries are facing climate change now. They do not need the IPCC to tell them that the weather is changing,\u201d said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, based in Dhaka. \nScientists have also lowered projections of sea-level rises. Depending on future greenhouse gas emissions, sea levels will rise an average of 40 \u201362 cm by 2100. Nevertheless, there will be signi\ufb01cant geographical variations; many millions of people living in the developing world\u2019s great cities, including Lagos and Calcutta, are threatened. \nWeather disasters are also more likely in a warmer world, the report suggests. Although the global frequency of tropical cyclones is expected to decrease or remain essentially unchanged, they may become more intense, with stronger winds and heavier rainfall. \nLife in many developing-country cities could become practically unbearable, given that urban temperatures are already well above those in surrounding countryside. Much higher temperatures could reduce the length of the growing period in some parts of Africa by up to 20%, the report said. \nDr Camilla Toulmin, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, says: \u201cClimate models are not yet robust enough to predict impacts at local and regional scales, but it is clear that everybody is vulnerable in some way.\u201d \nThe charity Oxfam predicted that world hunger would worsen as climate changes inevitably hurt crop production and disrupt incomes. They suggested the number of people at risk of hunger might climb by 10% to 20% by 2050, with daily per-capita calorie availability falling across the world. \n\u201cThe changing climate is already jeopardizing gains in the \ufb01ght against hunger, and it looks set to worsen,\u201d said Oxfam. \u201cA hot world is a hungry world. If the remainder of the 21st century unfolds like its \ufb01rst decade, we will soon experience climate extremes well outside the boundaries of human experience.\u201d"}
