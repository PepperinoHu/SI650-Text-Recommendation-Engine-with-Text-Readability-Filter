As JFK said, our problems are manmade and can be solved by man.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019ve never had better tools to make a difference,\u201d he told the A-level and UK \u2013US exchange students at the Q&A session. \u201cReject pessimism, cynicism and know that progress is possible. Progress is not inevitable; it requires struggle, discipline and faith.\u201d \nBut Obama acknowledged the challenges faced by young people: \u201cNot to say your generation has had it easy, in a time of breathtaking change, from 9/11, 7/7 \u2026 and during an age of information and Twitter where there\u2019s a steady stream of bad news.\u201d \nThe audience cheered as the president was introduced and went on to speak about his policies, including healthcare and education. \nHe urged the audience to interact with people with different political beliefs: \u201cSeek out people who don\u2019t agree with you and it will also help you to compromise.\u201d \nObama also said: \u201cYou should feel encouraged social attitudes are changing. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fast enough but you should keep pushing and it\u2019s in part due to the courageous acts of young people like yourself.\u201d \nWhen asked about his presidential legacy, Obama said he was proud of the healthcare reforms, which received huge cheers from the audience, and said of the US response to the 2008 financial crisis: \u201cSaving the world from great depression \u2013 that was quite good.\u201d \nHe also listed diplomatic deals with Iran and the response to the Ebola crisis as highlights of his presidency. \u201cI\u2019m proud; I think I\u2019ve been true to myself during this process.\u201d \nBut he added: \u201cDon\u2019t give up and succumb to cynics if, after five years, poverty hasn\u2019t been eradicated \u2026 It\u2019s OK. Dr Martin Luther King says the arc of the moral universe is long but bends towards justice.\u201d \nQuestioned on the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), he said: \u201cThe answer to globalization is not to pull up the drawbridge and shut off,\u201d though it was crucial to pay attention to workers\u2019 rights. \nBefore Obama arrived, Tanya Williams, a community engagement officer, told the Guardian: \u201cI love Michelle but I like Obama and it\u2019s exciting to have the chance to hear someone who has changed so much and galvanized so many people who didn\u2019t vote before.\u201d \nOliver Sidorczuk, 26, said: \u201cEveryone is extremely excited to listen to what he has to say. I\u2019m going to ask him about electoral rights and try to ask him if he would join our campaign to ask David Cameron for automatic registration.\u201d \nObama ended the session by taking a question from a young Sikh Londoner, who asked about the issue of racial profiling at airports and being mistaken for a Muslim. \nObama said that, although there were people with \u201ccrazy ideology\u201d, pluralism was important. \u201cI visited a mosque a few months ago and said our greatest allies are American Muslims who are most integrated and economically well off,\u201d he said. \nFurqan Naeem, a campaigner from Manchester, said: \u201cI recently visited the States through the US embassy on the community leaders programme and saw first hand some really important work the president did in celebrating America\u2019s diversity and bringing communities together.\u201d \nKenny Imafidon, the managing director of the youth organization ClearView Research, said afterwards: \u201cIt was a great opportunity and what will stick with me is what he said about meeting with people who have different politics from you and having to make compromises. Also, the thing he said about being a good leader and finding great talent.\u201d \nLater, Obama met Jeremy Corbyn, who said they had an \u201cexcellent\u201d 90-minute discussion. \nThe Labour leader said they talked about \u201cthe challenges facing postindustrial societies and the power of global corporations, and the increasing use of technology around the world and the effect that it has.\u201d\nAsked if they talked about the president\u2019s intervention in the debate on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, Corbyn said it was discussed briefly. \nAfter the meeting, Obama joined Cameron to play golf at the Grove in Chandlers Cross, Hertfordshire. Obama ended the day at a dinner with the prime minister and the US ambassador, Matthew Barzun, at the ambassador\u2019s residence, before travelling on to Germany."}
