{"id": "C1-694", "contents": "\ufeffThe customer next to you in the queue looks innocent enough. But, instead of a shopping list, you notice she\u2019s carrying handwritten notes about the appearance and cleanliness of the store. She\u2019s been timing the progression of the queue on her phone \u2026 and is that a tiny camera lens peeking out from her purse? The odds are you\u2019ve just spotted a mystery shopper. \nThere are approximately 50,000 mystery shopping trips carried out every month in the UK, according to the Mystery Shopping Providers Association, and, as more and more spending takes place online, the demand for mystery shoppers is growing. \u201cRetailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who are prepared to set foot in a physical store want a service and an experience they can\u2019t get online,\u201d says Simon Boydell, spokesman for Marketforce, which has more than 300,000 mystery shoppers on its books. \u201cOur clients want to measure how well their stores are delivering on that experience.\u201d \n\u201cWe assign different store locations to each shopper and rotate them so that they never go back to the same shop within three months,\u201d says Jill Spencer of mystery shopping company ABa. \u201cEach day, they typically spend up to eight hours visiting five to ten stores, plus another hour or two filing detailed reports on every aspect of their visit.\u201d For that, the mystery shoppers can earn up to \u00a3155 a day. They are also reimbursed for their petrol and hotel stays, and compensated for their car depreciation (the shoppers can be expected to drive as many as 20,000 miles a year). Meanwhile, video mystery shoppers, who film their visits with a hidden camera planted in a buttonhole or handbag, can earn even more \u2013 around \u00a3300 a day. \nShoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy. \u201cI\u2019m typically given between \u00a35 and \u00a320 to spend at each store, to assess the service I receive at the till,\u201d says Laura, a 50-year-old mystery shopper from Devon, who has been paid to visit around 7,000 shops since 2001. The purchase usually has to be related to a service or a type of product that the retailer wants her to check. \u201cI\u2019m always given a scenario, such as buying something from a specific department or a new product range, but, within that framework, I can often buy whatever I want \u2013 and keep it.\u201d \nLike most full-time mystery shoppers, Laura is self-employed, taking jobs from ABa and other mystery shopping companies as and when they come up. Her income is typically \u00a330,000 to \u00a340,000 a year and that doesn\u2019t include all the freebies she gets on the job. \u201cWith the perks, it\u2019s enough to live on. But I don\u2019t do it because I love shopping. In fact, I hate shopping now. When I\u2019m not working, it pains me to have to go out and buy a pint of milk.\u201d She does, however, find it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved. \u201cI know it must be because of my feedback or why would they pay me to give it? Some of the retailers I shop at win awards for customer service and I think that is down to us mystery shoppers. I feel I\u2019m not just doing a service to my company; I\u2019m doing a service to all shoppers everywhere.\u201d \nSadly, regular mystery shopping assignments that pay like Laura\u2019s are few and far between. In fact, competition is so fierce, she keeps her job a closely guarded secret and even her friends and family don\u2019t know who she works for (Laura is not her real name). \nIt\u2019s estimated that more than 500,000 people have registered as mystery shoppers in the UK, but just 10% or less manage to get regular work each month and this has led to a dramatic reduction in compensation. \u201cWhere once you got a fee, reimbursement for your purchase and mileage, you now often just receive a contribution towards a purchase,\u201d say Val, a 51-year-old former mystery shopper. \u201cI worked for 40 different mystery shopping companies for almost 20 years but I gave up entirely three years ago because I had bills to pay and very few assignments paid what I considered to be an acceptable rate.\u201d \nNowadays, mystery shopping companies mostly rely on the promise of freebies to incentivize their workers. \u201cMarketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort,\u201d says Boydell. \u201cAt the most, we\u2019ll pay \u00a315 to \u00a325 plus reimbursement for, say, a meal for two or a hotel stay. We don\u2019t directly employ any shoppers so we don\u2019t have to pay them the minimum wage.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d go on a cruise for nothing,\u201d says Laura. \u201cBut I think mystery shopping companies that pay you a nominal fee to travel to a restaurant and eat a meal are exploiting people. I won\u2019t touch those jobs anymore.\u201d There are plenty of people, however, that would. Hannah, a 41-year-old City lawyer, has conducted nearly 500 visits for the Mystery Dining Company in her spare time without receiving remuneration or travel expenses. As a prestigious \u201cplatinum diner\u201d, she is regularly hand-picked by the Mystery Dining Company to carry out their most exclusive assignments, enjoying \u00a3200 meals at Michelin-starred Mayfair restaurants, five-star hospitality at Ascot and overnight stays at boutique hotels. \nBut there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch, even if you work for a mystery dining company. Hannah says she typically spends two to four hours after each visit writing detailed reports on everything from the quality of the food to specific interactions with staff, whom she always needs to be able to name or \u201csubtly\u201d describe. Trickiest of all, she must memorize all these details while eating her meal \u2013 unable, of course, to openly write anything down. \n\u201cThere\u2019s lots to remember and sometimes it can detract from the experience. You\u2019re expected to give feedback while it\u2019s fresh, so I\u2019ve had to get up at 5am to write a report before work. It\u2019s a challenging thing to do; you need to be focused, articulate and detail orientated.\u201d"}
