We really appreciate you stepping in to support us. I know you had to put in extra hours to catch up on your own work, so thank you very much.  \nYour expertise was vital for this project and we couldn't have finished it successfully without you. You really helped us and we hope to work with you again on future projects.\nI'll be in touch again soon about possible future collaborations. I look forward to working with you more closely this year.\nAll the best,\nPaco"}
