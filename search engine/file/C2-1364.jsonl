{"id": "C2-1364", "contents": "\ufeffNobody knows which came first: the economic crisis tearing Greece apart or shisha, the drug now known as the \u201ccocaine of the poor\u201d. What everyone does accept is that shisha is a killer; and at \u20ac2 or less a hit, it is one that has come to stalk Greece, the country long on the frontline of Europe\u2019s financial meltdown. \n\u201cAs drugs go, it is the worst. It burns your insides, it makes you aggressive and ensures that you go totally mad,\u201d said Maria, a former heroin addict. \u201cBut it is cheap and it is easy to get, and it is what everyone is doing.\u201d \nThis drug crisis has put Athens\u2019s health authorities, already overwhelmed by draconian cuts, under further strain. \nThe drug of preference for thousands of homeless Greeks forced on to the streets by poverty and despair, shisha is described by both addicts and officials as a variant of crystal meth, whose potential to send users into a state of mindless violence is underpinned by the substances with which the synthetic drug is frequently mixed: battery acid, engine oil and even shampoo. \nWorse still, it is not only readily available but easy to make \u2013 tailor-made for a society that sees little light at the end of the tunnel. \n\u201cIt is a killer, but it also makes you want to kill,\u201d said Konstantinos, a drug addict. \u201cYou can kill without understanding that you have done it. And it is spreading faster than death. A lot of users have died.\u201d \nFor Charalampos Poulopoulos, the head of Kethea, Greece\u2019s pre-eminent anti-drug centre, shisha symbolizes the depredations of a crisis that has led to record levels of destitution and unemployment. It is, he said, an \u201causterity drug\u201d \u2013 the response of dealers who have become ever more adept at producing synthetic drugs designed for those who can no longer afford more expensive highs from such drugs as heroin and cocaine. \n\u201cThe crisis has given dealers the possibility to promote a new, cheap drug, a cocaine for the poor,\u201d said Poulopoulos at a centre run for addicts in Exarcheia, the anarchist stronghold in Athens. \u201cShisha can be sniffed or injected and it can be made in home laboratories \u2013 you don\u2019t need any specialized knowledge. It is extremely dangerous.\u201d \nAcross Greece, the byproducts of six straight years of recession have been brutal and cruel. Depression, along with drug and alcohol abuse, has risen dramatically. Delinquency and crime have soared as Greek society has unravelled under the weight of austerity measures that have cut the income of ordinary Greeks by 40%. Prostitution \u2013 the easiest way of financing drug addiction \u2013 has similarly skyrocketed. \n\u201cDesperation is such that many women agree to engage in unprotected sex because that way they\u2019ll make more money,\u201d said Eleni Marini, a British-trained psychologist with Kethea. \u201cShisha has been linked to a very intense sexual drive but it attacks your ability to think straight and we\u2019re seeing a lot more pregnancies among drug addicts who engage in prostitution.\u201d In 2012, two sex workers gave birth on the streets of Athens. \nAt a time when suicides have also shot up and the spread of HIV infections has assumed epidemic proportions, drug addicts (a population believed to be around 25,000 strong) have become increasingly self-destructive. And, experts say, young Greeks marginalized by record rates of unemployment \u2013 at 64% Greece has the highest youth unemployment in the EU \u2013 are leading the way. \n\u201cThe crisis has created a widespread sense of pessimism,\u201d said Poulopoulos. \u201cFor those who might have quit drugs, there is now no incentive. Instead, there\u2019s an atmosphere of misery, where people knowing they won\u2019t find work are becoming a lot more self-destructive. In Athens, where the economic crisis has hit hardest, shisha is part of that.\u201d \nGreece\u2019s conservative-dominated coalition government has tried to deal with the problem by driving drug users and other homeless people out of the city centre \u2013 a series of controversial police operations has swept central streets, clearing crowded doorways and malls. \n\u201cBut with such actions, authorities are only sweeping the problem under the carpet,\u201d said Poulopoulos. \u201cWhat, in reality, they are really doing is marginalizing these people even more by pushing them into the arms of drug dealers who offer them protection.\u201d \nJust when the demand for help has never been greater, state-funded organizations such as Kethea have had their budgets slashed by a third at the request of the \u201ctroika\u201d \u2013 the EC, ECB and IMF \u2013 keeping the debt-stricken Greek economy afloat. \nSince the outbreak of the crisis in 2009, Kethea has lost 70 of its 500 staff. The cuts come despite studies showing that, for every euro invested in programmes such as Kethea, the state saves about \u20ac6 in costs to the criminal justice and healthcare systems. \u201cThe cuts we have witnessed are a false economy, a huge mistake,\u201d said Poulopoulos. \nOn the streets of Athens, the breeding ground of shisha, there is rising fear that austerity not only doesn\u2019t work \u2013 it kills."}
