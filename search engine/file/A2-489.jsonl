Why are you?\nI'm taking this class because it's a requirement.\nWe should get to know each other.\nI don't think so. I like keeping to myself.\nSo you don't like meeting new students?\nNope. I would rather just be alone.\nThat is so sad!\nIt's not. It's really peaceful and self-empowering.\nCan we at least study together?\nNope, we can't do that."}
