While, as in the UK, no one has fallen ill from eating mislabelled produce, the outbreak of anger shows no sign of abating. Consumers who believed they had eaten prized kuruma shrimps, for example, were told they had in fact dined on the much cheaper black tiger version. \nThe first incident went almost unnoticed. The Prince Hotel in Tokyo was forced to come clean after a diner complained in a blogpost that a 'scallop' dish he had ordered contained a similar, but cheaper, type of shellfish. \nThe hotel launched an investigation and went on to correct more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants. Its report scared Hankyu-Hanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they, too, had hoodwinked diners who believed they were paying high prices for premium ingredients. \nThe Hotel Okura chain \u2013 whose guests have included Barack Obama \u2013 confessed myriad sins, including injecting beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly describing tomatoes as organic. \n\u201cWe deeply apologize for betraying the expectations and confidence of our clients,\u201d it said in a statement. \nThe list of fraudulent ingredients continues to grow: orange juice from cartons sold as freshly squeezed; Mont Blanc desserts topped with Korean chestnuts instead of the promised French ones; bought-in chocolate cream masquerading as home-made; imported beef sold as high-end wagyu. \nEven the government\u2019s top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, was moved to comment on the scandal. \u201cThese incidents have surfaced one after the other and this inappropriate labelling has resulted in the loss of trust among consumers,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThese are clearly cover-ups.\u201d \nThe fraudulent menu scandal has exploded at just the wrong time. Japan is trying to persuade South Korea and other countries to lift bans on food imports imposed in response to the Fukushima nuclear accident, while UNESCO is considering a request to add Japanese cuisine to its intangible cultural heritage list. \nOne local newspaper ran the headline, \u201cJapan\u2019s proud food culture in tears,\u201d while the mass circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said it was \u201castonished by the industry\u2019s lack of morals.\u201d \nThe newspaper voiced concerns that the scandal could \u201charm the credibility of brand Japan, products and services, which are praised by foreign countries and tourists for their safety and security.\u201d \nIndustry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 had forced luxury hotels to cut costs while attempting to woo diners with detailed menu descriptions. \n\u201cMenu descriptions were created to meet consumers\u2019 preference for brand products, and, when they couldn\u2019t obtain the ingredients stated on the menu, hotels just used food from different places of origin,\u201d Hiroshi Tomozawa, a hotel and restaurant consultant, told Kyodo News. \nWhile they count the cost to their reputations, the hotels and restaurants involved are unlikely to face legal action. Menus are not covered by the agricultural standards law or by a new food labelling law due to go into effect in 2015. The authorities\u2019 only legal weapon is a law banning misleading representations of goods and services. \nThe industry\u2019s biggest nemesis will be Japan\u2019s discerning and demanding consumers. In a 2009 poll conducted by an online restaurant guide, 72% of respondents said provenance was the most important factor in selecting dishes from a menu, followed by calorific and nutritional details."}
