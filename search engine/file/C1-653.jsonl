Stratford remained hugely important throughout Shakespeare\u2019s life, argues Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. \n\u201cPeople have seen Shakespeare as someone who turns his back on Stratford and his family, goes to London to earn his fortune and only comes back to die,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Stratford is where he bought land and property, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought. We are going to spend the year re-emphasizing the importance of Shakespeare, the man of Stratford.\u201d The seveneenth-century diarist, antiquarian and gossip John Aubrey, born 11 years after Shakespeare died, was at pains to point out there was nothing so very special about the bard. Aubrey, university educated, unlike Shakespeare, said that he acted \u201cexceedingly well\u201d and that \u201chis Playes took well \u201d. The world has not agreed with Aubrey. The anniversary of the death of the man from Stratford, the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world, will be marked across Britain and the globe. \nMacbeth will open in Singapore, Romeo and Juliet in Brussels. Shakespeare\u2019s Globe is completing the first world tour in the history of theatre, in which it has taken Hamlet to almost every country \u2013 North Korea is still holding out. In London, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, one screen to showcase each of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, along the South Bank. \nThe National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and virtually every other theatre production company in the country will be marking the anniversary. Interpretations will range from the resolutely traditional to the Brighton-based Spymonkey\u2019s Complete Deaths, a romp through the 74 deaths \u2013 75 including a fly squashed in Titus \nAndronicus \u2013 by stabbing, poisoning, smothering and smashing across the plays. There will also be hundreds of lectures, recitals, international academic conferences, films, concerts, operas and major exhibitions. \nFor a man famous in his own lifetime, there is little documentary evidence for Shakespeare\u2019s life and times. The plays would scarcely have survived if his friends and fellow actors had not gathered together every scrap of every play they could find \u2013 drafts, prompt scripts, scribbled actors\u2019 parts and 17 plays not known in any other version \u2013 into the precious First Folio published in 1623, seven years after Shakespeare\u2019s death. \nThe actor Mark Rylance has called it his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving First Folios will be on display \u2013 including those belonging to the British and Bodleian libraries, and a tattered copy recently discovered in France. Some of the most precious surviving documents will be gathered together in an exhibition at Somerset House in London, jointly organized by the National Archives and King\u2019s College London, including four of his six known signatures, which are all slightly different. \nThe exhibition, By Me, William Shakespeare, will include his will, the court papers relating to the audacious move when Shakespeare and his fellow actors dismantled a theatre on the north side of the Thames and rebuilt it as the Globe on the South Bank, and accounts showing payments from the royal treasury for Boxing Day performances for James I and Queen Anne. \nThe outgoing Globe director, Dominic Dromgoole, recently jokily claimed Shakespeare as a true Londoner \u2013 albeit conceding \u201csome spurious claim\u201d by Stratford-upon-Avon. Stratford, however, will be insisting that the town made and educated Shakespeare. His old school room is being restored with a \u00a31.4m Heritage Lottery grant and will open as a permanent visitor attraction. \nShakespeare bought the splendid New Place, the second best house in the town, where he died, according to literary legend, on St George\u2019s Day, 23 April, the same day as his birth. \u201cYou don\u2019t buy a house like New Place and not live there,\u201d Paul Edmondson said. \u201cThe general public and many academics have consistently underestimated the importance of Stratford to Shakespeare.\u201d \nEdmondson believes that, after Shakespeare bought the house in 1597, all his thinking time was spent there and that the late plays, including The Tempest, were at least planned in his library and probably written there. The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust describes New Place as \u201cthe jewel in the crown of the 400th anniversary celebrations\u201d but, in truth, it is more of a gaping hole where the gem should be. \nShakespeare\u2019s house was demolished 300 years ago and the house that replaced it, probably incorporating some of the original fabric, was flattened in 1759 by an irascible clergyman, Francis Gastrell, in a row over taxes. He had already cut down Shakespeare\u2019s mulberry tree, under which the writer is said to have sat and worked, because he was irritated by all the tourists peering into his garden. \nThe gap in the Stratford streetscape has never been filled but a five-year archaeology project has peeled back the years and the news that Shakespeare\u2019s kitchen had been found in the partly surviving cellars went round the world. The whole site is being redisplayed for the anniversary, with the foundations marked and the garden restored. \u201cWithout Stratford,\u201d Edmondson said, \u201cthere would have been no Shakespeare.\u201d"}
