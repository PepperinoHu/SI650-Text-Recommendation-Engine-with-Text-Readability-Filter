{"id": "C2-1487", "contents": "\ufeffEurope is to become the first place in the world to force 'real-world' emissions tests on car makers, opening up a new front in the fight to tackle air pollution. New regulations will introduce the tests to reveal what cars\u2019 emissions are like when driving on roads and in traffic rather than in ideal, laboratory-like conditions, as is currently the case. \nGreen lit by European Commission Vice President, Frans Timmermans, the tests are designed to enforce a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre, a level met by only one car out of 16, according to researchers. Other countries, such as China and Korea, which are also considering real-world emissions tests, will be watching what happens next closely. \nPollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and particulates are thought to be responsible for at least one quarter of the 29,000 annual pollution-related deaths in the UK alone. That figure is likely to rise, when the committee on the medical effects of air pollutants publishes what it calls \u201cstrengthening evidence\u201d of damage to public health from nitrogen oxide emissions later in 2015. \nBut the current 'New European Drive Cycle' laboratory test for measuring these emissions is a quarter of a century old and has been outpaced by technological developments in the car industry. Studies have shown that the results of lab techniques to measure car emissions can easily be fixed by using techniques such as taping up doors and windows to minimize air resistance, driving on unrealistically smooth roads and testing at improbably high temperatures. Campaigners say that car makers also use tricks such as programming vehicles to go into a low emissions mode when their front wheels are spinning and their back wheels are stationary, as happens in such lab experiments. \n\u201cThe Commission is finalizing a proposal to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow proper assessment of the vehicles in real driving,\u201d said Lucia Caudet, a Commission spokesperson. The proposal still needs approval from other commissioners and a technical committee but \u201cwe don\u2019t expect any major internal hurdles,\u201d a European Union (EU) source added. \n\u201cOne key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 citizens annually is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars, causing many times more pollution on the road,\u201d said Greg Archer, the clean vehicles manager for Transport and Environment. \u201cThe development of a new, real-world driving emission test is an important step forward in tackling urban air pollution. EU states should now support the Commission\u2019s proposals and ignore the whingeing from car makers that the rules are too tough.\u201d \nAccording to research by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg/km standard, with some models running at 22 times above the recommended limit. Only one car out of 16 met the 80g target. Around one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport \u2013 mostly diesel \u2013 and, in urban areas, concentrations can rise as high as 64%, European Environment Agency figures indicate. \nCampaigners say that the car industry has tried to delay reforms to car test cycles but industry groups deny this, arguing that a five-year lead-time is necessary for technical and economic reasons. \u201cReal Driving Emissions (RDE) is a totally new regulation that will force significant emission control hardware changes that may be demanded in the middle of a vehicle\u2019s production lifetime,\u201d said Cara McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). \u201cHowever, ACEA fully accepts that RDE will apply to new types of cars from September 2017.\u201d \nIn an unusual move, the car association sent Timmermans a draft regulation of their own for him to consider, after EU representatives finally agreed a regulation to implement the nitrogen oxide limits with beefed-up road trials and strict monitoring of exhaust fumes. ACEA\u2019s draft regulation would have covered fewer pollutants and further delayed the regulation\u2019s phased introduction until 2020. Test distances would have been shortened from 1,300m to below 700m, minimum temperatures would have been raised from -7C to -3C and more rural roads would have been used. \u201cThe lobbyists were all over this,\u201d Archer said. \u201cThis was a real attempt at subversion of the legislative process.\u201d \nAfter Timmerman\u2019s apparent rejection of the ACEA proposal, the regulation will now pass to commissioners for a rubber stamp, and member states for final amendments, before an expected introduction in September. By 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests are expected to begin in earnest. With a similar battle already looming over the testing of CO 2 emissions for cars at the end of 2015 \u2013 and with comparable debates in other countries \u2013 the introduction of the EU\u2019s new emissions tests will be watched closely."}
