The weatherman said there is a high probability of rain.\nSince when have you started watching the news?\nI've always watched the news. Well, at least to check out the weather.\nWhat else did they say about the weekend?\nI think they said it was going to rain throughout the weekend.\nThroughout the weekend? Don't pull my chain.\nI'm not. They said it, not me. I know you had plans.\nWell, I don't believe it. Just like I don't believe you watch the news.\nOkay, suit yourself. I'd take an umbrella though.\nI won't. I'd rather get wet than listen to you."}
