It's not what people want, he says.\nWhat's more, by eliminating minibars from rooms, hotels can actually save costs, says Dell.\n When -LRB- we -RRB- remove any content from the minibar it takes a considerable number of tasks out of every -LRB- housekeeper's -RRB- day, so there's time saved, headcount saved, therefore money saved, which is reflected in the overall price -LRB- of rooms -RRB-, he says.\nBetter for a property to focus on amenities guests prioritize, such as Internet access.\n Connectivity is as ubiquitous as the telephone 20 years ago, when it had to be in the room, or like your own shower or bathroom has to be in the room. \n$10 Coke not right '\nOthers think the minibar simply needs to evolve to changing needs of guests.\n We ca n't just give hot and cold running water, says Dean Winter, area director of operations of Hong Kong Hotels & China Projects at Swire Hotels.\nTake the example of Swire's Hong Kong property, Upper House -- each room features a complimentary selection -LRB- beer, soda, healthy juices, coconut water and snacks -RRB- and a separate, chargeable wine fridge.\n We wanted to differentiate ourselves to appeal to discerning business and leisure travelers without following the traditional routes of five-star hospitality, explains Winter.\nHe thinks charging $5-10 for Coke is not the right thing to do, as people remain price conscious.\n People appreciate a complimentary minibar or Wi-Fi or movies, and paying a rate and not all these add-ons, he says.\nLess hard booze\nToday there's far less hard liquor, complimentary or not.\nTen years ago, JW Marriott yanked the petite bottles of liquor out of its chargeable minibars in its Hong Kong hotel, citing low consumption.\nAt The Mira Hong Kong, miniature spirits were phased out in 2011.\nAccording to the property, the hard liquor was removed as we prefer to tempt our guests with drinks and entertainment at our open air lounge bar Vibes, and cocktail bar Room One with a live band. \nOnly corporate or high-paying guests get the fully complimentary minibar.\nCheap trumps convenient\nThe minibar is also increasingly part of an all-inclusive package.\nAt Hong Kong's Ovolo Hotel, the complimentary scheme is extensive: guests get a free minibar, breakfasts, plus two-hours free booze daily at its O Lounge, including all spirits and wine.\nRemoving the prices has also helped remove the headache of arguing with guests over what exactly they did or did not consume, says the hotel manager in Ovolo's Aberdeen branch, Chum Roa.\n It was a source of many disputes in hotels, he says. If the customer persists they had nothing, often hotels absorb the cost to not ruin guest relations over minibar items. \nNow, he does n't have to deal with that.\nRoa imagines a future in which the traditional minibar is extinct.\n The competitor of the minibar is n't nearby hotels but the 24-hour stores where one can get everything you need a few blocks away, he says.\nThe convenience of having a cold drink in your room is n't quite enough if you have to pay three times as much for it, it seems.\nWill you miss minibars in hotel rooms or say good riddance to shockingly priced beer and M&M's ?
