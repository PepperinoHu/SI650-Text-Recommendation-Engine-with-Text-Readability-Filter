Jordan Axani, a 28-year-old Toronto real-estate developer turned charity founder, made it back to Canada with Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher but said the pair had \u201cforged a brother-sister-like relationship\u201d. \nAxani had made headlines in 2014 after offering an air ticket to any Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher. He had booked a three-week vacation with his ex-girlfriend but, after they split up, he was unable to change the name on the flights. \nThat\u2019s where Axani\u2019s new travelmate, a 23-year-old student from Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia, came in. Gallagher, who goes by the name Quinn, replied to a Reddit post Axani had submitted \u2013 along with other hopeful Elizabeth Gallaghers \u2013 and was selected. Gallagher had made it clear before the trip that she had a \u201cpretty serious\u201d boyfriend but that had not stopped romantics, and journalists, from hoping the globetrotters might fall for one another. Unfortunately, it was not to be. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy and it certainly wasn\u2019t immediate. It took us about a week to really figure each other out,\u201d Axani said. There was a certain amount of \u201cnatural stumbling\u201d around \u201cthe dos and don\u2019ts of travelling together\u201d as the pair got to know each other.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be explicitly clear,\u201d Axani said, shortly after the pair returned to Toronto. \u201cThis was never a romantic endeavour. It was strictly platonic. I do not think of Quinn in a romantic light in the least. There is no future for us romantically. She is a good friend. I think of her as a little sister but that will be it. And her feelings are entirely mutual in that regard.\u201d It took work to establish that brother-sister, good-friend, no-future-for-us-romantically relationship, however. other. \u201cAt the end of it, we\u2019d developed a really great rhythm of, one second, having really funny inside jokes, and, the next second, knowing when the other needed space.\u201d \nAlthough the pair failed to fall for one another, Axani said the trip, which took in Milan, Venice, Vienna, Prague, Khao Lak (in Thailand) and Hong Kong, was \u201cfantastic\u201d. A favourite place was Prague, Axani said, where they \u201chad the largest groundswell of people reaching out\u201d. \n\u201cOver the course of two and a half days, I think we met about two dozen people. So that\u2019s a lot of stories, that\u2019s a lot of individuals and that\u2019s a lot of love for their home city of Prague.\u201d \nPeople were following the pair on Twitter and Instagram, Axani said, and they were even recognized in the street in Hong Kong. \u201cIt was a real adventure. We had a blast. We learned a lot about ourselves and about each other. I think, coming out of it, I can\u2019t imagine it going much better than it did.\u201d \nAxani made it back to Toronto at 3am on Monday, 12 January, when the holiday came to an abrupt halt. He went straight into a board meeting with fellow board members at his charity, A Ticket Forward. Axani started the non-profit organization after his Reddit post went viral and intends to offer round-the-world-trips to survivors of abuse, cancer and war. \nAlongside that, Axani is also in talks to spin his story into a television show or film, although he would not comment on what form those productions might take. \u201cSuffice to say there\u2019s been significant interest from many production companies. We\u2019re well advanced.\u201d In terms of his love life, Axani said he was not looking for his next Elizabeth Gallagher just yet. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for anything, per se, but life happens and we\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. \u201cAs always, life\u2019s a journey.\u201d"}
