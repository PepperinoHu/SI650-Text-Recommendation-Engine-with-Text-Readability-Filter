After a gentle warm-up and a few pulse-raising numbers, the 93-year-old great-grandmother lets her charges rehydrate with a cup of tea and a quick sit down. \nSome of the eight-strong class look as if they need it more than others. Allen herself, wearing a thick turquoise shirt, navy knitted waistcoat, black slacks and sensible shoes, has not broken into a sweat. Despite an \u201cexcruciating\u201d trapped nerve in one leg and a knee in need of replacement, she looks as though she could go on for hours. \nThe general rule is that eating directly before sport is not the best idea, let alone part way through. But, on the afternoon I visit Allen\u2019s class at a church hall in Saltburn-by-the-Sea near Middlesbrough, slices of fruitcake are being passed around during the break. The cake has been baked in honour of Allen\u2019s recent birthday by her 89-year-old sister, Joan, known locally as the \u201cscone queen of Saltburn\u201d. \nThe ladies have barely swallowed their last crumb when Allen is up again, leading the group through a jaunty Scottish number involving lots of toe pointing and leg kicking. Forty-five minutes later, the class is finally over. \nAllen, a former volunteer with the Red Cross, has been leading classes in the north-east seaside town for 45 years. Not particularly sporty at school, she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war \u2013 \u201cjust for something to do during the blackouts, really\u201d \u2013 and eventually took over in her 40s when the previous instructor retired. At its peak, Allen\u2019s class had more than 18 regulars, each paying \u00a31 a time. But, these days, her flock is diminishing fast \u2013 during the teabreak, the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them had attended that week for one of the younger members of the group who had just died, aged 68, from motor neurone disease. \nAllen is the oldest, followed by her sister. The baby of the group is 60-year-old Jean Cunion, who credits the group with supporting her through a difficult time when her mother died. She is somewhat embarrassed to admit that she is perhaps the least fit of the group. \u201cI remember, the first time I came, Margaret said: 'Who\u2019s that huffing and panting?' and I had to admit it was me.\u201d Ruth Steere, 76, marvels at how Allen never misses a trick, despite always having her back to the class: \u201cShe always shouts at us if we go wrong. She\u2019s remarkably good at knowing what we are doing.\u201d \nAllen, a keen dancer, has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor. Instead, she choreographs her own moves based on five tapes from the BBC\u2019s first ever fitness guru, Eileen Fowler, who died in 2000 when she was 93, Allen\u2019s age now. Allen thinks her good health is largely down to keeping busy, especially since her husband Joe died in 1997. She took up writing poetry when she was 80. \n\u201cI write poems about everything. I\u2019m a prolific writer. I just can\u2019t stop,\u201d she says, phoning me a few days after the interview to read out a ditty she has written about the joys of exercise. One of the class, 84-year-old former teacher Winnie Robertson, thinks the secret to staying fit is never letting yourself go: \u201cUse it or lose it, that\u2019s what I say.\u201d \nAllen still plays the piano and gives speeches. She is president of the Women\u2019s Fellowship at the local methodist church and is one of three 90-plus year olds at the scrabble club of the University of the Third Age. She did a computer course when she was 88 and tried to get online, but it didn\u2019t work out. \nAgeing is no fun, she admits, reading me a few lines from a poem she has written called 'That Beast Called Age'. She happily recalls a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years back, who said she couldn\u2019t possibly be more than 78: \u201cI said, 'Thank you, doctor. You can go now.'\u201d \nShe also has a no-nonsense attitude to weight gain: \u201cI just think people shouldn\u2019t eat too much. Whenever I hear someone saying, 'Oh, I can\u2019t lose weight\u2019, I say:\u2019 Sellotape.'\u201d She mimes taping her mouth shut. \u201cI said this just the other day to a big fat man. Everything in moderation is my motto.\u201d \nEarlier in 2013, Allen was watching the news and saw a woman being given the British Empire Medal. I think she means Margaret Chartwood from Horley, who was given the honour in January, at the age of 77. \u201cShe was saying: 'I\u2019m 80 and I\u2019m the oldest fitness instructor in the country!' I was thinking: 'No, you\u2019re not.' But I shan\u2019t be writing to Buckingham Palace.\u201d"}
