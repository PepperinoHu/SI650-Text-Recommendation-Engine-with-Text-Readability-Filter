{"id": "C2-1338", "contents": "The terms \u201cidealism\u201d and \u201cidealist\u201d are by no means used only within philosophy; they are used in many everyday contexts as well. Optimists who believe that, in the long run, good will prevail are often called \u201cidealists\u201d. This is not because such people are thought to be devoted to a philosophical doctrine but because of their outlook on life generally; indeed, they may even be pitied, or perhaps envied, for displaying a na\u00efve worldview and not being philosophically critical at all. Even within philosophy, the terms \u201cidealism\u201d and \u201cidealist\u201d are used in different ways, which often makes their meaning dependent on the context. However, independently of context one can distinguish between a descriptive (or classificatory) use of these terms and a polemical one, although sometimes these different uses occur together. Their descriptive use is best documented by paying attention to the large number of different \u201cidealisms\u201d that appear in philosophical textbooks and encyclopedias, ranging from metaphysical idealism through epistemological and aesthetic to moral or ethical idealism. Within these idealisms one can find further distinctions, such as those between subjective, objective and absolute idealism, and even more obscure characterizations such as speculative idealism and transcendental idealism. It is also remarkable that the term \u201cidealism\u201d, at least within philosophy, is often used in such a way that it gets its meaning through what is taken to be its opposite: as the meaningful use of the term \u201coutside\u201d depends on a contrast with something considered to be inside, so the meaning of the term \u201cidealism\u201d is often fixed by what is taken to be its opposite. Thus, an idealist is someone who is not a realist, not a materialist, not a dogmatist, not an empiricist, and so on. Given the fact that many also want to distinguish between realism, materialism, dogmatism, and empiricism, it is obvious that thinking of the meaning of \u201cidealism\u201d as determined by what it is meant to be opposed to leads to further complexity and gives rise to the impression that underlying such characterizations lies some polemical intent.\nWithin modern philosophy there are sometimes taken to be two fundamental conceptions of idealism:\nsomething mental (the mind, spirit, reason, will) is the ultimate foundation of all reality, or even exhaustive of reality, and\nalthough the existence of something independent of the mind is conceded, everything that we can know about this mind-independent \u201creality\u201d is held to be so permeated by the creative, formative, or constructive activities of the mind (of some kind or other) that all claims to knowledge must be considered, in some sense, to be a form of self-knowledge.\nIdealism in sense (1) has been called \u201cmetaphysical\u201d or \u201contological idealism\u201d, while idealism in sense (2) has been called \u201cformal\u201d or \u201cepistemological idealism\u201d. The modern paradigm of idealism in sense (1) might be considered to be George Berkeley\u2019s \u201cimmaterialism\u201d, according to which all that exists are ideas and the minds, less than divine or divine, that have them. (Berkeley himself did not use the term \u201cidealism\u201d.) The fountainhead for idealism in sense (2) might be the position that Immanuel Kant asserted (if not clearly in the first edition of his Critique of Pure Reason (1781) then in his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783) and in the \u201cRefutation of Idealism\u201d in the second edition of the Critique) according to which idealism does \u201cnot concern the existence of things\u201d, but asserts only that our \u201cmodes of representation\u201d of them, above all space and time, are not \u201cdeterminations that belong to things in themselves\u201d but features of our own minds. Kant called his position \u201ctranscendental\u201d and \u201ccritical\u201d idealism, and it has also been called \u201cformal\u201d idealism. However, Kant\u2019s position does not provide a clear model of idealism at all. While Kant himself claimed that his position combined \u201cempirical realism\u201d with \u201ctranscendental idealism\u201d, that is, combined realism about external, spatio-temporal objects in ordinary life and science with the denial of the reality of space and time at the level of things as they are in themselves, it also insisted upon the reality of things as they are in themselves existing independently from our representations of them, thus denying their reducibility o representations or the minds that have them. In this way, Kant\u2019s position actually combines the transcendental ideality of space and time with a kind of realism about the existence of things other than minds.\nSo instead of using Kant as any kind of model for epistemological idealism, in this entry we will distinguish between metaphysical and epistemological arguments for idealism understood as a metaphysical doctrine, namely that everything that exists is in some way mental. We thus agree with A.C. Ewing, who wrote in 1934 that all forms of idealism\nhave in common the view that there can be no physical objects existing apart from some experience, and this might perhaps be taken as the definition of idealism, provided that we regard thinking as part of experience and do not imply by \u201cexperience\u201d passivity, and provided we include under experience not only human experience but the so-called \u201cAbsolute Experience\u201d or the experience of a God such as Berkeley postulates. (Ewing 1934: 3)\nin other words, while reducing all reality to some kind of perception is one form of idealism, it is not the only form\u2014reality may be reduced to the mental on other conceptions of the latter. Thus Willem deVries\u2019s more recent definition of idealism as the general theory that reduces reality to some form or other of the mental is just:\nRoughly, the genus comprises theories that attribute ontological priority to the mental, especially the conceptual or ideational, over the non-mental. (deVries 2009: 211)\nWe also agree with Jeremy Dunham, Iain Hamilton Grant, and Sean Watson when they write that\nthe idealist, rather than being anti-realist, is in fact \u2026 a realist concerning elements more usually dismissed from reality. (Dunham, Grant, & Watson 2011: 4)\nnamely mind of some kind or other: the idealist denies the mind-independent reality of matter, but hardly denies the reality of mind (or, on their account, which goes back to Plato, Ideas or Forms as well as minds; we will not consider pre-modern forms of idealism in any detail). However, following Ewing (see his chapters II, IV\u2013V, and VIII), we will distinguish metaphysical from epistemological arguments for idealism. Metaphysical arguments proceed by identifying some general constraints on existence and arguing that only minds of some sort or other satisfy such conditions; epistemological arguments work by identifying some conditions for knowledge and arguing that only objects that are in some sense or other mental can satisfy the conditions for being known. In particular, epistemological arguments for idealism assume that there is a necessary isomorphism between knowledge and its object that can obtain only if the object of knowledge is itself mental; we propose that this is the difference between epistemologically-motivated idealism and a more neutral position, which might be identified with philosophers such as Rudolf Carnap, W.V.O. Quine, and Donald Davidson, holding that of course we always know things from some point of view, but any \u201cexternal\u201d question about whether or not our point of view \u201ccorresponds\u201d to independent reality is either meaningless or at least not answerable on theoretical grounds. It is in order to preserve the distinction between traditional idealism and positions such as the latter that we recommend retaining the claim that reality is in some way or other exclusively mental and thinking of epistemological arguments for idealism rather than epistemological idealism as such.\nOf course these strategies can be combined by a single philosopher. Berkeley does so, and so does Kant in arguing for the transcendental idealist part of his complex position. Others separate them, for example F.H. Bradley and J.McT.E. McTaggart constructed metaphysical arguments for idealism, while Josiah Royce and Brand Blanshard offered epistemological arguments.\nIn what follows, we will concentrate mainly on the discussion of philosophical theories that either endorse or claim to endorse idealism on ontological and/or epistemological grounds. At some points in its complex history, however, above all in the social as well as philosophical movement that dominated British and American universities in the second half of the nineteenth century and through the first World War, idealism in either of its philosophical forms was indeed connected to idealism in the popular sense of progressive and optimistic social thought. This was true for figures such as Bradley and Royce and their predecessors and contemporaries such as Thomas Hill Green and Bernard Bosanquet. There has recently been considerable interest in British or more generally Anglophone idealism as a movement in social philosophy, or even a social movement, but we will not pursue that here (see Mander 2011; Boucher & Vincent 2012; Mander [ed.] 2000; and Mander & Panagakou [eds.] 2016)."}
