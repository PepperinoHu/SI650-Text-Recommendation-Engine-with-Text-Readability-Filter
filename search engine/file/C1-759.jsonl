People do n't talk about what movies they watched but about which ones they missed. \nREAD MORE: Shanghai Culture Plaza: Building Asia's Broadway\nRave reviews\nSome Broadway shows have captivated Chinese audiences. French revolution epic Les Miserables was a hit when it debuted in Shanghai in 2002.\nMore recently, a Chinese-language version of Mamma Mia ! that toured in August 2011 grossed 20 million yuan -LRB- $3.2 million -RRB- in less than a month and according to the China Daily, a 2013 production of The Phantom of the Opera sold out five months before its premiere.\nBut high ticket prices mean these shows reach a limited audience, and it's typically only the most accessible Broadway hits that resonate with a Chinese audience, says Zhou Yinchen, the head of the Folk Music and Musical Research Center at Peking University's Academy of Arts.\n Mamma Mia !is entertaining, that's why Chinese accept it, she says. Of course there are other Broadway musicals but it's only those with the highest entertainment value work in China, she adds.\nNonetheless, the rave reviews audiences have given to these shows make musical producers like San Bao confident that combining Broadway showmanship with Chinese plot lines will one day result in a sure-fire hit.\nCartoon character\nAs well as China's imperial past, San Bao has also made shows about a Chinese cartoon character similar to Tintin, and the Chinese Communist Party's Long March -- a 6,000 mile journey that helped cement Mao Zedong's stature as a great leader.\nSan Bao says one of the biggest challenges he faces is the dearth of all-round performers.\nFew Chinese actors and actresses have equally strong singing and dancing skills that musical theater requires, he said.\nAnd while China does offer some undergraduate courses in musical theater, these departments are relatively new and the level of expertise is not deep.\nXu Luyang, a classical music critic, also says that musical productions often ca n't afford the high pay necessary to attract top talent.\n The musical industry is China is still immature, he said.\nRather than continuing to rely on the government's largesse, San Bao says he is looking for investors to fund his next project and hopes that will give him freer creative rein.\n The reason why I produce musicals and will keep doing it is because I like it very much. \nREAD MORE: Spin: Chinese musicals take center stage\nSerena Dong reported from Beijing, Katie Hunt wrote from Hong Kong."}
