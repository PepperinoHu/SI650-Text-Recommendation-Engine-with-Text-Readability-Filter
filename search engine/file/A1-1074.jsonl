I will tell my family to save you a seat.\nWhat position will you be playing?\nI will be playing first base, but the coach may switch me.\nIf he switches you, what position will you play?\nI think he wants me to pitch.\nYou are a pitcher as well?\nYes, I am. I'm still training, but I can throw.\nI didn't know that about you.\nWell, hopefully you can see me pitch today.\nAwesome! I can't wait."}
