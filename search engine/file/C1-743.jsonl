{"id": "C1-743", "contents": "\ufeffSometimes life just isn\u2019t fair. Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook and is now worth an estimated $48bn. James Goodfellow also invented something used by millions of people around the world every day \u2013 the cash machine \u2013 but it didn\u2019t make him rich. In fact, he earned just \u00a310 from the patent and has not made a penny more from it since. \n\u201cYou can imagine how I feel when I see bankers getting \u00a31m bonuses. I wonder what they contributed to the banking industry more than I did to merit a \u00a31m bonus. It doesn\u2019t make much sense to me but that\u2019s the way of the world,\u201d Goodfellow says. \nIt also annoys him that he\u2019s not seen as a good role model for inventors and engineers. He came up with a groundbreaking invention that generated billions of pounds \u201cand I got nothing, so who\u2019s going to want to follow in James Goodfellow\u2019s footsteps and get \u00a310 if they have a fantastic success?\u201d \nThere have been arguments for years over who should officially go down in history as \u201cthe inventor of the ATM\u201d and, in 2005, a man called John Shepherd-Barron received a UK honour for services to banking as the \u201cinventor of the automatic cash dispenser\u201d. But, the UK government is now saying it was Goodfellow who invented the ATM \u2013 so it would seem that, after all the squabbling, his place in history is now assured. \nBack in the mid-1960s, Goodfellow was working as a development engineer and had been asked to devise a way to enable customers to withdraw cash from banks on Saturdays. \u201cMost people working during the week couldn\u2019t get to the bank. They wanted a solution. The solution was a machine which would issue cash on demand to a recognized customer,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI set out to develop a cash-issuing machine and, to make this a reality, I invented the PIN [personal identification number] and an associated coded token.\u201d \nThis token took the form of a plastic card with holes punched in it. The patent documents proposed a system incorporating a card reader and buttons mounted in an external wall of the bank and stated: \u201cWhen the customer wishes to withdraw a pack of banknotes from the system, he simply inserts his punched card in the card reader of the system and operates the set of ten push-buttons in accordance with his personal identification number.\u201d \nAside from the cards with punched holes, that pretty much describes today\u2019s ATM. After Goodfellow successfully demonstrated the methodology by producing a model, prototypes were built and the first machines were installed in 1967. \nAt around the same time, Shepherd-Barron was developing a rival cash-dispensing device. His machine didn\u2019t use plastic cards \u2013 instead, it used cheques impregnated with carbon-14, a mildly radioactive substance. The machine detected the carbon-14, matched the cheque against a PIN and paid out the cash. \nIt is widely accepted that the Shepherd-Barron ATM was the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d when it comes to being installed and used by the public; the first one, at a bank in north London, was opened on 27 June, 1967 \u2013 a month before Goodfellow\u2019s ATM made its public debut. However, the patent for Goodfellow\u2019s machine was lodged on 2 May, 1966, 14 months before the London ATM machine came into service. \nThe rivalry between the two men bubbled up when Shepherd-Barron received an official honour for his achievement. Goodfellow says: \u201cMy one big regret is that I never said anything about it until John Shepherd-Barron received the OBE in 2005. This honour was granted on the basis that he was the inventor of the automatic cash dispenser. That really stuck in my throat and I kicked up a bit of a fuss.\u201d Shepherd-Barron is no longer alive to put his case but, in a 2005 interview, he was fairly withering about his rival: \u201cI don\u2019t know him but it\u2019s clear that the difference between Goodfellow and us was that we thought through the whole system concept and that was important to the banks who bought it. His invention reminds me of the hovercraft, an elegant failure.\u201d \nThe cash machine has become a world-conquering piece of technology and nothing \u2013 the contactless revolution, bitcoin, wearable technology, etc \u2013 seems to be slowing its growth: there are now 3m ATMs worldwide, with the number forecast to hit 4m by 2020. \nGoodfellow accepts he didn\u2019t invent the concept of a cash-issuing machine \u201cbut I did invent a way of doing it. When people talk about the Wright brothers, they didn\u2019t invent the concept of flying \u2013 everyone was trying to do it \u2013 but they did it and got the credit for inventing the aeroplane so I think I should get the credit for inventing the cash dispenser.\u201d \nThe good news for Goodfellow is that this is now starting to happen. The website ATMInventor.com concludes: \u201cWho invented the idea of an ATM? We believe it was Luther George Simjian. Who invented the ATM as we know it? We have to think it was James Goodfellow in Scotland for holding a patent date of 1966. Who invented the ATM design we recognize today? We think it was John D White for Docutel in the US.\u201d \nEven better for Goodfellow, his achievement has been officially recognized in the latest edition of a 180-page guidebook called Life in the United Kingdom. In the section about \u201cgreat British inventions of the twentieth century \u201d, it states: \u201cIn the 1960s, James Goodfellow (1937-) invented the cash-dispensing automatic teller machine (ATM) or 'cashpoint'.\u201d \nSo after all these years, Goodfellow finally finds himself being talked about in the same breath as John Logie Baird (the television), Alan Turing (the Turing machine), Sir Frank Whittle (the jet engine) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the World Wide Web). Asked what he did with the \u00a310 he received back in the 1960s, Goodfellow says he thinks he blew it on a wild night out, adding: \u201cIt didn\u2019t change my life.\u201d But, he concludes, it\u2019s been a good working life: \u201cI was very happy doing the job I was doing.\u201d"}
