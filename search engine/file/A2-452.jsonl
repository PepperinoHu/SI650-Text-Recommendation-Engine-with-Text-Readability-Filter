Hurry up and get out of bed!\nI can't, the blankets won't let me go.\nQuit being lazy and get up!\nNo, I have to finish my awesome dream!\nI can't believe you turned off your alarm this morning.\nWhy? I do it every morning.\nIf you don't get out of bed, you'll get to school late.\nThat's not so bad.\nHow is it not so bad?\nSleep is good for growing children.\nYes, but you have a math test this morning!\nI completely forgot! I'm up, I'm up!"}
