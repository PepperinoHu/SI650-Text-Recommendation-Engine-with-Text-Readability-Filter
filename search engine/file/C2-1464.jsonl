{"id": "C2-1464", "contents": "David Hume (Hume 1748/2000; cf. Voltaire 1764/1901: 272) famously defined a miracle as \u201ca violation of the laws of nature,\u201d and this definition has been the focus of lively discussion ever since. Hume evidently means to denote something beyond mere changes in the regular course of nature, raising the bar higher for something to qualify as a miracle but also raising the potential epistemic significance of such an event if it could be authenticated.\nBringing the concept of natural laws into the definition of \u201cmiracle\u201d is, however, problematic, and for a variety of reasons many writers have found it untenable (Brown 1822: 219\u201333; Beard 1845: 35; Lias 1890: 5\u20137; Huxley 1894:154\u201358; Joyce 1914: 17; Hesse 1965; Montgomery 1978; but see Wardlaw 1852: 27\u201341). First, the concept of a miracle predates any modern concept of a natural law by many centuries. While this does not necessarily preclude Hume\u2019s concept, it does raise the question of what concept or concepts earlier thinkers had in mind and of why the Humean concept should be thought preferable (Tucker 2005). One benefit of defining miracles in terms of violations of natural law is that this definition entails that a miracle is beyond the productive power of nature. But if that is the key idea, then it is hard to see why we should not simply use that as the definition and leave out the problematic talk of laws.\nSecond, it becomes difficult to say in some cases just which natural laws are being violated by the event in question (Earman 2000). That dead men stay dead is a widely observed fact, but it is not, in the ordinary scientific use of the term, a law of nature that dead men stay dead. The laws involved in the decomposition of a dead body are all at a much more fundamental level, at least at the level of biochemical and thermodynamic processes and perhaps at the level of interactions of fundamental particles.\nThird, there are deep philosophical disagreements regarding the nature and even the existence of natural laws. On Hume\u2019s own \u201cregularity\u201d view of natural laws, it is difficult to see what it would mean for a natural law to be violated. If the natural laws are simply compendious statements of natural regularities, an apparent \u201cviolation\u201d would most naturally be an indication, not that a supernatural intervention in the course of nature had occurred, but rather that what we had thought was a natural law was, in fact, not one. On metaphysically rich conceptions of natural laws, violations are problematic since the laws involve relations of necessity among universals. And on the view that there are no natural laws whatsoever, the set of events satisfying the Humean definition of a miracle is, trivially, empty.\nSpeaking of miracles as violations of the laws of nature also raises questions about the nature of violation. Richard Swinburne (1970) has suggested that a miracle might be defined as a non-repeatable counter-instance to a law of nature. If a putative law has broad scope, great explanatory power, and appealing simplicity, it may be more reasonable, Swinburne argues, to retain the law (defined as a regularity that virtually invariably holds) and to accept that the event in question is a non-repeatable counter-instance of that law than to throw out the law and create a vastly more complex law that accommodates the event.\nOne way to get around all of these problems and still retain the Humean formulation is simply to redefine the laws of nature. J. L. Mackie sums up this perspective neatly:\nThe laws of nature \u2026 describe the ways in which the world\u2014including, of course, human beings\u2014works when left to itself, when not interfered with. A miracle occurs when the world is not left to itself, when something distinct from the natural order as a whole intrudes into it. (Mackie 1982: 19\u201320)\nWith the notion of \u201cnatural law\u201d thus redefined, the \u201cviolation\u201d definition becomes virtually equivalent to the earlier definition of a miracle as an event that exceeds the productive power of nature. And in Mackie\u2019s formulation it has the desirable feature that it makes evident the connection between a miracle and supernatural agency."}
