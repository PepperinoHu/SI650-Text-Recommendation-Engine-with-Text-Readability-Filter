These were the words most infamously abused by a headline in The Sun newspaper, above stories which we now know, in extraordinarily shocking detail, were fed by the South Yorkshire Police to deflect their own culpability for the disaster on to the innocent victims. \nMargaret Aspinall, whose son James, then 18, died at what should have been a joyful day out, an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, said the families had been forced to fight, for 23 years, for just that: the truth. Aspinall, Chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said that, although the families\u2019 loss would never fade, she was \u201cdelighted\u201d at the unequivocal, \u201cprofound\u201d apology given for Hillsborough\u2019s savage failings by David Cameron. \nThe Hillsborough Independent Panel had inspected 450,000 documents generated by the police, Sheffield Wednesday and all other bodies responsible, and delivered its remarkable 395- page report indicting official failings and vindicating the victims and football supporters. \nSome of what happened to cause the disaster, and the police\u2019s subsequent blame-shifting, has been exposed before. But the depth of what the families call a cover-up, in particular the deliberate police campaign to avoid its own responsibilities and falsely blame the supporters, was still startling. \nIn a concerted campaign \u2013 led, the panel found, by the Chief Constable, Peter Wright \u2013 the South Yorkshire Police put out their story that drunken supporters or those without tickets had caused the disaster. The victims had their blood tested for alcohol levels. This was \u201can exceptional decision \u201d, the panel said, for which it found \u201cno rationale \u201d. When victims had alcohol in their blood, the police then checked to find if they had criminal records. \nThe report, substantially authored by Professor Phil Scraton of Queen\u2019s University, Belfast, and unanimously agreed by the panel of eight experts, found there was \u201cno evidence \u2026 to verify the serious allegations of exceptional levels of drunkenness, ticketlessness or violence among Liverpool fans \u201d. \nThe report found that even as the nightmare began for the families of the victims, Wright was meeting his police federation in a Sheffield restaurant to prepare \u201ca defence\u201d and \u201ca rock- solid story \u201d. The Secretary of the South Yorkshire Police Federation branch, Constable Paul Middup, told the restaurant meeting before Wright turned up: \u201cThe Chief Constable had said the truth could not come from him, but had given the secretary a totally free hand and supported him,\u201d as had many senior officers. \nThe meeting was held just four days after the disaster. It was the day that The Sun splashed its headline \u201cThe Truth\u201d over lies fed to it by four senior South Yorkshire police officers. Middup was encouraged to continue this police campaign of defaming Liverpool supporters for supposed drunkenness and misbehaviour and \u201cto get the message \u2013 togetherness \u2013 across to the force \u201d. \nThe panel\u2019s report sustained the allegation made in parliament that the orchestrated changing of junior officers\u2019 statements by senior South Yorkshire police officers amounted to a \u201cblack propaganda unit \u201d. The officers\u2019 statements, presented as official police accounts to the subsequent inquiry, were changed to delete criticism of the police themselves on the day, and, largely, emphasize misbehaviour by supporters. The panel found that 116 of 164 statements were amended \u201cto remove or alter comments unfavourable to South Yorkshire police \u201d. \nThe police had claimed this was done only to remove \u201cconjecture\u201d and \u201copinion\u201d from the statements, but the panel had no doubt the operation, to craft a case rather than deliver truthful police accounts, went further. \u201cIt was done to remove criticism of the police,\u201d Scraton said. \nThis propaganda did not convince the original inquiry, which ruled as quickly as August 1989 that the police stories of fan drunkenness and misbehaviour were false, and criticized the police for making the claims. The report revealed that Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s football ground was unsafe in crucial respects, that the Football Association had selected it as the venue for the match without even checking if Hillsborough had a valid safety certificate, which it did not. \nIn that landscape of neglect, it was the mismanagement of the crowd by the police, commanded by an inexperienced Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, that was \u201cthe prime cause\u201d of the disaster. The police lost control outside the ground, where 24,000 Liverpool fans had to be funnelled through just 23 turnstiles, so Duckenfield ordered a large exit gate to be opened and a large number of people to be allowed in. His \u201cblunder of the first magnitude \u201d, according to the inquiry, was the failure to close off the tunnel that led to the already overcrowded central section of the Leppings Lane terrace. \nThe inquiry report established this but the police, undaunted, repeated their claims to the subsequent inquest. Its procedure was marked by the coroner\u2019s decision not to take evidence of what happened after 3.15pm on the day of the disaster, thereby excluding an emergency response the panel found to have been chaotic. The finding that 41 of the 96 who died could possibly have been saved had the police and ambulance service done their jobs decently is damning of those bodies and, Aspinall said, difficult for the families to contemplate. \nIn the light of the panel\u2019s report, the Attorney General will now consider whether to apply to the High Court for the inquest verdict of accidental death to be quashed and a new inquest held. There may be prosecutions too, after all these years, of Sheffield Wednesday, South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield City Council, which failed in its duty to oversee the safety of the football ground. Trevor Hicks, the President of the HFSG, both of whose teenage daughters, Sarah and Victoria, died in the crush, said: \u201cThe truth is out today. Tomorrow is for justice.\u201d"}
