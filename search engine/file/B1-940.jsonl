{"id": "B1-940", "contents": "After being told for the umpteenth time that the beer she wanted would be \u201ctoo dark and too strong for you, love \u2013 have something sweeter\u201d, Rebecka Singerer had had enough. \n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want a fruit beer. Women can drink whatever we want,\u201d she says. \nNow Singerer, a childminder, has joined FemAle, a group of like-minded drinkers in Gothenburg, to launch Sweden\u2019s first beer made by women. \nWe Can Do It, a bottled pale ale, has just gone on sale in stores across Sweden. Its label is a take on Rosie the Riveter, the creation of a US Second World War propaganda campaign that went on to become a symbol of women\u2019s power in the workplace. \nThe group\u2019s founder is Elin Carlsson, 25, who paints cars at the Volvo factory outside the city. \u201cWe Can Do It is not a female beer but a beer brewed by women that anyone can drink,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with feminism; it\u2019s about equality \u2013 we wanted to show we can do it.\u201d \nFemAle is up against decades of prejudice in the beer world. In an irony not lost on FemAle, Carlsberg and other big brewers have spent millions in recent years trying to sell beer to women, attempting to \u201cpink it and shrink it\u201d to appeal to perceived feminine tastes. Carlsberg\u2019s Eve and Copenhagen offerings, Foster\u2019s Radler and Coors\u2019s Anim\u00e9e were among lighter, flavoured and even \u201cbloat-resistant\u201d beers that failed to find a market. \nFemAle\u2019s approach is different, with women- only tastings that allow potential customers to experiment with flavours and styles of beer that they may not normally try. This education process is the way to \u201cget more girls into the beer world\u201d, the group says. \u201cBring your mother, sister, girlfriend, aunt and grandmother so we can all learn more about beer.\u201d \nThe idea for FemAle arose after the women kept bumping into each other at beer festivals. \nWe Can Do It was the brainchild of Felicia Nordstr\u00f6m, a bar worker who says she was fed up with bearded beer snobs telling her: \u201cWhat do you know about beer, sweetie?\u201d She approached FemAle and they teamed up with Ocean, a local independent micro-brewery. One weekend they concocted the recipe and the next they brewed 1,600 litres. \n\u201cThis is not a beer that is aimed at women \u2013 it\u2019s our hoppiest brew,\u201d says Thomas Bingebo, the head brewer at Ocean. \u201cWhen the big breweries target women, it usually fails. This is something completely different.\u201d \nThe first batch of We Can Do It was sold out almost before it was brewed. FemAle has already been approached by other breweries asking if they can brew new beers with them. \nWe Can Do It uses three malts \u2013 Maris Otter, Amber and a Thomas Fawcett wheat malt \u2013 and the hop varieties Galaxy and Cascade. Its IBU, or bitterness level, is 65 and its alcohol content is 4.6%. \n\u201cWomen opt for a glass of wine because they don\u2019t know what beer is all about; they don\u2019t know what to order,\u201d says Carlsson. \u201cWe open up new worlds to them.\u201d \n\u201cI used not to like stout but, back then, I only drank Pripps [a light, Swedish lager],\u201d says Singerer, 38. \u201cGuinness tastes like water to me now. There are imperial stouts that are like drinking biscotti dipped in espresso.\u201d \nThe women are part of a brewing explosion in Sweden, which is developing a passion for \u201ccraft\u201d ales, bottled and on draught. The standard stor stark (large strong) lager is now \u201calmost extinct\u201d in Gothenburg, the women say, as pubs and bars replace the big brands with a choice of specialist beers. \n\u201cAll the girls are different \u2013 there is no typical woman beer-lover. Anyone can do it,\u201d says Emma Henriksson, 22, a group member who works in a garden equipment company. \n\u201cEvery pub wants to learn how to reach women,\u201d adds Singerer. \u201cAnd Elin has found the way. It\u2019s awesome. We feel so proud.\u201d"}
