He misses dinner dates. He forgets to give presents. \nAnd so, like seemingly everyone in Silicon Valley, the 27-year-old venture capitalist has come up with a start-up to fix it: BetterBoyfriend.me, a service that sends girlfriends and wives a present every month for about $70. \nSullivan, who works in finance, has been quietly testing the program and has signed up about 350 boyfriends generating about $17,000 revenue every month. Most members, he says, are from his collection of Harvard and investor friends: venture capitalists, founders and employees of companies like Apple, Google and Facebook, whose girlfriends have been getting presents from Sullivan for the last year. \nEach month, Sullivan\u2019s members choose from a list of seven possible gifts (chocolate, tea sets, manicures). The package is sent to the boyfriend unbranded and unlabelled. \nHe tests his ideas by buying Facebook ads just to see what kind of traction they get. BetterBoyfriend.me took off. \u201cBetterBoyfriend hit something,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pain point everyone has.\u201d \nBetterBoyfriend.me was not Sullivan\u2019s first idea. For a couple of days, he thought about a dog-sharing pitch: \u201cI see all these rich guys looking just miserable walking dogs and I realized: a dog is only valuable 5% of the time,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, what if we got a guy who would babysit the dogs and other people could rent them out?\u201d \nAnother start-up, called InvisibleBoyfriend, allows users \u201cto design and build a believable social partner who is everything you want and is always available to talk, whenever you want\u201d. The end result is a \u201cboyfriend\u201d who can text with you all day. \nFounder Kyle Tabor launched it to give users a faux boyfriend to deter unwanted advances but has found people have grown attached to their algorithmic partners: \u201cMany more users are seeking companionship through conversation rather than external 'proof' of a relationship to get people off their back.\u201d \nFor Sullivan and Tabor, the surprise was the real relationships that have formed with their customers. Sullivan says he has begun to see himself as a sort of relationship consultant for the boyfriends. \nSullivan admits he\u2019s made mistakes. Early on, the packages included receipts that had his name on them, Dan Sullivan. \u201cOne of the boyfriends wrote to me and said, 'Listen, dude, she\u2019s not mad but Cynthia found out'.\u201d \nAbout 50% of the women BetterBoyfriend.me deliver packages to know about his involvement in their relationships: \u201cIt\u2019s correlated with age. I think, after you\u2019ve been married a while, you don\u2019t keep many secrets.\u201d \nAnd over the year, the young founder says he\u2019s got to know the boyfriends really well. They\u2019ve even done a delivery to a hospital delivery room. The key, he said, is to remember that his relationship is with the boyfriend. \nWhen he first launched his company, he attached tags that said BetterBoyfriend.me to flower bouquets and set off for Dolores Park, a popular lounging spot in the tech- and youth-heavy Mission District. \n\u201cI looked for couples and gave the bouquet to the girl but that didn\u2019t go down well with the boyfriend. Like, not at all. It made sense, though. It was cool,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I reconsidered and started handing them out to the boyfriends.\u201d"}
