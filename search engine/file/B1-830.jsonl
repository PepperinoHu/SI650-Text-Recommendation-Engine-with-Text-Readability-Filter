{"id": "B1-830", "contents": "Improvements to Oak Hall\nIntroduction\nThis report aims to describe problems in Oak Hall of Residence and discuss possible maintenance work to solve them. The two biggest issues were discussed at a meeting on 12 May, which was attended by 165 of the 250 students who live in the building.\nIssue 1: temperature in rooms\nA number of students complained that the second-floor bedrooms are too hot. Concerns were raised about lack of sleep and students finding it hard to study in their rooms. Air conditioning was suggested as a possible solution.\nHowever, there is no budget left for installing air conditioning this academic year. Also, installation can only be carried out during holidays as students cannot be present in the building while the work takes place.\nIssue 2: improving wheelchair access to Oak Caf\u00e9\nIt was noted that wheelchair users can only access Oak Caf\u00e9 from the back and not the front entrance nearer the lifts. This makes access to the caf\u00e9 difficult for wheelchair users. The university is looking to improve its wheelchair access in general by installing ramps in key areas and work can take place during term time with no issues for staff or students.\nConclusion and recommendations\nTaking the factors mentioned into account, August would be the best time for the installation of air conditioning. Until then, the university could consider supplying fans to each second-floor room so students can sleep and study comfortably.\nThe front of the caf\u00e9 is recommended as an ideal place to install a wheelchair ramp. This work can take place immediately and should be a priority."}
