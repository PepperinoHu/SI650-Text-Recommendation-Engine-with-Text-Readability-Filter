{"id": "A1-1063", "contents": "Can you explain baseball to me?\nI can try to explain the basics. What do you want to know?\nWhat are strikes?\nEvery batter has three strikes. When they get three strikes, they are out.\nOkay, but what about when the umpire calls a ball?\nOnce an umpire calls four balls, then the batter goes to first base.\nWhat happens when a pitcher hits a batter with the ball?\nThe batter goes to first base.\nWhat if someone is on first base?\nThen whoever was on first base goes to second base.\nOh, okay. What's a no-hitter?\nA no-hitter is when a team doesn't get a hit throughout the game.\nSo, that's a good thing for the pitcher?\nYes, because that means he pitched really well."}
