{"id": "B2-280", "contents": "\ufeffThat millennials rely heavily on technology is no secret. More than eight in ten say they sleep with a mobile phone by their bed, almost two thirds admit to texting while driving, one in five has posted a video of themselves online and three quarters have created a profile on a social networking site. \nCompared to other generations, millennials are the most active on social media, according to a 2010 report, with 75% of them having created at least one social media account. In contrast, only 50% of Generation X, 30% of baby boomers and 6% of those aged 65 and older use social media. But there is a small percentage of millennials who don\u2019t use social media at all. Meet the millennials bucking the trend. \nCelan Beausoleil, 31, Oakland, California Beausoleil is a social worker and has had an \u201con and off, more off than on\u201d relationship with Facebook. \nShe last deactivated her account in December 2015 after finding the amount of personal information shared by others \u201ctoo heavy\u201d to deal with on top of her work demands. \n\u201cA lot of my job is listening to people\u2019s lives all day, every day and it started to feel so overwhelming to go on social media and see every single detail of everybody\u2019s life, including people that I don\u2019t really have a relationship with,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels almost like intimacy overload.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m holding a lot in my work life for people and sometimes it felt like it was too heavy to do in my personal life also.\u201d \nBut Beausoleil does love the way social media connects the world in a truly unique way, citing it as one of her only reasons for staying on Facebook for as long as she did. \u201cOne thing I really liked about Facebook was that I could sit for hours and click on a friend and then click on one of their friends and one of their friends and one of their friends and literally end up on someone\u2019s Facebook page from the other side of the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to do that all the time.\u201d \n\u201cOne day, I realized I\u2019m spending so much time doing this. These little seconds add up. I wonder what it would be like if I didn\u2019t spend these seconds here and spent them doing something else. What if I was doing other things with these seconds? What would they become? Would I enjoy it?\u201d \nMathias, who works for the Baltimore City government, had Facebook and Twitter accounts for years before deleting them both in November 2012. But he \u201cquickly forgot that Facebook existed\u201d after his impromptu decision to end his social media presence. He can still appreciate the benefits that come with having social media accounts, like when he met his girlfriend\u2019s friends for the first time and realized \u201chumanizing 20 people you\u2019re meeting at a party\u201d is much easier if you can connect their faces, hometowns and jobs to a photo later on. Or how easy it is to organize large events online. Mathias relies on friends for party invites and is sure there are times he \u201cslips through the cracks\u201d. \nBut, now, he relishes the time that\u2019s freed up. He spends his lift rides and spare moments at work reading news articles and books rather than scrolling through a newsfeed. And with no friends\u2019 accounts to follow online, he has to \u201cpick up the phone and call them\u201d, something he\u2019s come to \u201cdefinitely enjoy\u201d. \nLauren Raskauskas, 22, Naples, Florida Raskauskas describes herself as a \u201cpretty private\u201d person. So social media, which can open you up to the scrutiny and analysis of others, is not that appealing to her. \u201cI\u2019m more privacy-minded and have concerns about giving out my data,\u201d said Raskauskas, who is currently looking for a job. \nShe recently deleted her Twitter account and deactivated her Facebook account two years ago after realizing she \u201cdidn\u2019t like everyone knowing what I was doing\u201d. But Raskauskas, who was late to the Facebook game because her \u201cparents were really strict with technology\u201d, can see the positive sides of social media. When a friend of hers that she\u2019d lost track of moved to Naples for a month, Raskauskas didn\u2019t even realize she was there until after she\u2019d left, which the 22-year-old said \u201cwas a bummer\u201d. \nBut in the end, her privacy concerns outweighed any benefits social media could provide and she saw a definite upside when she went through a recent break-up. The last time a relationship of hers ended and she was online, it was not pleasant. \n\u201cOne time, I did break up with somebody while I was on Facebook and I was like \u2019Oh my gosh, should I change my profile photo? Should I change my status?\u2019 And, this time, I don\u2019t have to worry about any of that because that kind of stuff is pretty hard,\u201d she said. \nRajagopalan, a student at Boston College, doesn\u2019t see any drawbacks to abstaining from social media. \nHe claims that he \u201chasn\u2019t seen any effect at this point\u201d. Even though classmates post about parties and events on Facebook, they make sure to send him a text message, too, he said. \u201cSince I was young, I was always a step behind on that kind of thing so it never really mattered to me,\u201d he said. \nIn fact, the only time Rajagopalan made use of social media was when it was unavoidable: it was the only way to reach his new roommate at college. Before starting his first year at college, he signed up for his first, and only, social media account. He joined Facebook in order to contact his future roommate and talk about their plans for that year. \nMonths later, he still has the account but he admits: \u201cI don\u2019t use it. I don\u2019t check it or anything like that.\u201d The most activity it sees is when his two sisters tag him in family photos. He has avoided social media accounts in all other situations, though he has felt the draw of Twitter. As a sports fan, he acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s where most of the news breaks out\u201d. But he refused to get an account, stating: \u201cI don\u2019t really need one to read tweets\u201d."}
