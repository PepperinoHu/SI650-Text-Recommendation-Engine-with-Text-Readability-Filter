India\u2019s wealthiest will quadruple their net worth between now and 2018, a report says, with hundreds of thousands of new entrepreneurs and inheritors becoming multimillionaires. The survey, based on interviews with 150 ultra-high-net-worth individuals, comes amid signs of returning business confidence in the world\u2019s biggest democracy. \nRecent years have seen lacklustre growth, rising prices of basic foodstuffs and a weakening currency. But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a landslide victory in May 2014 on a pledge to reinvigorate the ailing economy. Despite the slowdown, there are nearly a sixth more Indians worth in excess of $3.75m than in 2013, the report for the Kotak Mahindra Bank notes. \u201cCities are mushrooming, the middle class population growing, opportunities have increased manyfold and the political environment has improved greatly in recent months,\u201d according to Murali Balaraman, a co-author. \nBetween them, India\u2019s rich hold assets worth a trillion dollars, which is around a fifth of the total wealth in the country. By 2018, that total is likely to reach $4tn, the report says, making three times as many people multimillionaires. \nServing the new rich \u2013 and the old money \u2013 is a booming luxury market. \u201cThey really want to show or talk about their wealth in a really subtle way and consumption of luxury goods is a nice way to do it,\u201d Balaraman said. Abhay Gupta, the CEO of brand consultancy Luxury Connect, said the market for top-end goods and experiences would \u201conly get bigger\u201d. \u201cThere is a huge aspirational class who look up to what the very wealthy are doing and then copy it,\u201d he said. \nCars are among the most popular items bought, the report says. Whereas, in 2009, locally made SUVs were shown off by the wealthy, now only foreign cars will turn heads. Mercedes saw a 47% surge in sales in India in 2013. BMW has launched a new $200,000 model in Delhi. India\u2019s appalling infrastructure restricts demand, however. Lamborghini\u2019s Chief Executive, Stephan Winkelmann, admitted, in 2013, that the traffic and roads in India \u201care not so suitable\u201d for the $450,000 sports cars. In India, Lamborghini sells two models: the Gallardo and the Aventador, which has a top speed of 217mph. Winkelmann said Lamborghini\u2019s Indian customers were much younger than those in Europe, with a typical buyer being in his 30s. However, the most popular investments remain real estate \u2013 mainly within India \u2013 and jewellery. \nIndia\u2019s super-rich have long raised eyebrows around the world with their spectacular spending. Mukesh Ambani, the country\u2019s wealthiest man, has built the world\u2019s most valuable home in Mumbai, the commercial capital. The 27-storey tower, complete with helicopter pads, indoor cinemas and a staff of more than 600, is worth an estimated $1bn. \nThe three-day wedding of the niece of Lakshmi Mittal, the UK-based steel tycoon who is worth an estimated $16bn, was reported to have cost $80m. Hundreds of guests were flown to Barcelona for the ceremony and party, which took place in a museum in the city. \nBut buyers of luxury goods searching for the psychological satisfaction of exclusivity are becoming increasingly demanding, the Kotak Mahindra report says. One ordered nine cases of Japanese whisky costing over $750 a bottle for a wedding reception. The attraction of the imported whisky was that no one who attended the wedding would find out how to source the same drink in India, the report adds. Another big spender systematically bought identical pairs of Louis Vuitton bags, then cut up half of them to make clothes that would match her accessories. Even the traditional wedding is evolving fast. Presents such as silver plates, dried fruit or sweets once sent with wedding invitations are being replaced by gifts by top western designer brands. \u201cThese days, it\u2019s Rolex watches and Louis Vuitton bags,\u201d says Gupta. \nAlmost half new ultra-high-net-worth individuals live in smaller provincial cities. A high proportion give substantial amounts to charity, though the report notes that the \u201cgrowth of philanthropic spends in India has not been proportional to overall growth in ultra-high-net-worth individual wealth\u201d. \nCo-author Balaraman says that growth in the number of rich people would not result in social tensions as a wide gap in incomes and wealth is an \u201caccepted norm\u201d in India. \u201cPeople know that someone is rich and someone is poor and they carry on with their lives,\u201d he explains."}
