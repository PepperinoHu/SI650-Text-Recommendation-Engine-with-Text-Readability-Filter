{"id": "C1-788", "contents": "\ufeffStriding on stage, Donald Trump had a surprisingly humble confession to make for someone defying all the laws of political gravity. \n\u201cUnless we win, it doesn\u2019t mean a damn thing,\u201d the would-be Republican presidential nominee warned a campaign rally in South Carolina, despite finishing his fourth month in a row at the top of the opinion polls. \u201cI want to pick my date for the election. I want it next Tuesday,\u201d he confided to the 11,000-strong crowd \u2013 typical of the grassroots support that needs to flourish into March 2016 for him to win the nomination, let alone November\u2019s general election. Such moments of self-doubt are fleeting, quickly replaced by the now-familiar bombast of a billionaire whose status as a \u201cwinner\u201d has become his defining policy platform. \nTrump is not the only one beginning to wonder whether his improbable campaign can confound the pundits and go the distance, particularly after a burst of recent controversy only seemed to cement his polling lead over bewildered rivals. Conventional wisdom holds that any one of these outbursts would have sunk most politicians by now. \nFirst, there was the time he outraged prisoners of war by doubting the heroism of Vietnam veteran John McCain because he allowed himself to be captured. Then, there was the first television debate, where he insulted Fox News moderator, Megyn Kelly, because she asked him difficult questions. \nAs if PoWs, Fox News and women were not enemies enough, Trump has also insulted Mexican immigrants to the US, claimed that a Black Lives Matter protester who was violently ejected from a rally deserved to be \u201croughed up\u201d, appeared to mock a New York Times journalist for his disability and falsely accused Muslim Americans of cheering on the 9/11 attackers. \nTrump has complained that many of these incidents were exaggerated by the political media, 70% of whom, he says, are \u201cscum\u201d. But, he has nonetheless refused to retract any of the comments. \u201cI could have said, 'Oh, I misspoke', but I am not big on that,\u201d Trump told the crowd in South Carolina. Some rivals still hope that, eventually, even Trump\u2019s supporters will tire of what critics view as his relentless attacks on minorities in particular. One poll shows his support among Republicans down by 12 points \u2013 although, at 31%, he still leads the field. \nOther opponents question whether there is much overarching political ideology to Trump. \u201cHe is an egomaniac; he\u2019s a narcissist. He\u2019s not a conservative, he\u2019s not a liberal \u2013 he believes in himself,\u201d former presidential rival, Bobby Jindal, told the Guardian, shortly before dropping out of the race. \nLiz Mair, a Republican strategist organizing an anti- Trump fundraising committee, worries that many of the comments seen as gaffes by the liberal media are, in fact, carefully designed to boost his standing with his core constituency. \u201cI personally think it\u2019s best that people who don\u2019t like Trump and his policies do some work to try to actively undercut him,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd not just pray for him to commit real political suicide.\u201d \nYet, there is more to Trump than attention-grabbing outrage. As he delights in telling supporters, the three issues that he rails against most \u2013 immigration reform, free-trade deals and Barack Obama\u2019s national security policy \u2013 have become perhaps the defining issues of the election. \nHis policies for deporting every undocumented immigrant in the US and demanding that Mexico pays for a border wall \u2013 \u201cA real wall. A very tall wall, taller than that ceiling.\u201d \u2013 might sound unrealistic but they have arguably destroyed the campaign hopes of Jeb Bush, who favours immigration reform. \nSo what might it take to stop Trump? One source of optimism among opponents is the strong evidence that polls this far away from election day are an average of eight percentage points out, simply because most people have not made up their minds. Among Americans who identify as Republicans, current polls suggest he has 25-30% of the vote. \nIn the battle for hearts and minds, converting Trump\u2019s passionate supporters will be hard. To blunt his lead, another candidate would need to tap into his support base without jeopardizing their own. Polling experts believe this to be unlikely, as it is hard to imagine anyone doing Trump better than Trump, let alone anyone doing Trump without sacrificing their own support. \nThis scenario can be best understood by looking at responses to the question: \u201cAre there any of these candidates you would definitely not support for the Republican nomination for president?\u201d While 20-30% of voters say they would support Trump, another 20-30% say they definitely would not. \nSteve Deace, a prominent Iowa conservative, said that Trump\u2019s antics are \u201cboth a good and a bad thing. On one hand, it produces a loyal following that is attracted to that persona which will not leave you. On the other hand, it limits your ability to grow beyond that.\u201d \nTop Republican pollster, Frank Luntz, believes Trump speaks for voters who, for the first time, feel as if they have a mouthpiece and like the fact that they feel like they are being heard. As the pollster notes: \u201cTrump says what they\u2019re thinking and, the more outrageous he is, the more they agree with him. He\u2019s saying what no politician would say and that\u2019s another reason they like him.\u201d \nThat is certainly the feeling among ordinary supporters who have attended his increasingly packed campaign events in recent months. \n\u201cI like the way he speaks,\u201d says Sandra Murray of Dubuque, Iowa. \u201cThis country is a huge mess and we need to get out of this and, honestly, he could be the man to do it.\u201d \nOther supporters offer a simpler explanation. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid of anybody or anything. That\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d"}
