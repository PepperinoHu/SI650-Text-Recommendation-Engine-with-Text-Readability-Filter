{"id": "C2-1459", "contents": "Contemporary analytic philosophers, feminist and nonfeminist, can be characterized roughly as follows: they consider (some of) Frege, Russell, Moore, Wittgenstein, and the Logical Positivists to be their intellectual ancestors; they tend to prize explicit argumentation and the literal, precise, and clear use of language; they often value the roles of philosophy of language, epistemology, and logic; and they typically view their stock of philosophical concepts, methods, and assumptions to be a) consistent with their Modern European heritage, and b) in contrast with methods originating in twentieth-century continental Europe, most recently those having names beginning with \u2018post\u2019: poststructuralism and postmodernism broadly conceived.\nOf course, each strand of mid-twentieth-century, \u201cclassic\u201d analytic philosophy has changed greatly. Many central dogmas have been undermined, and nonfeminists and feminists alike have \u201cnaturalized,\u201d \u201csocialized,\u201d and otherwise modulated the earlier, more abstract and highly normative enterprises and doctrines. However, regardless of the extent of the evolution of \u201canalytic philosophy,\u201d the degree to which methodological boundaries are blurred today, and the fruitfulness of intersections among methods, a number of feminist and nonfeminist philosophers continue to think of themselves in the historical trajectory of analytic philosophy and find the tradition valuable. They claim the term \u2018analytic philosopher\u2019 for themselves, even if some others might find the term \u2018post-analytic\u2019 more appropriate.[2]"}
