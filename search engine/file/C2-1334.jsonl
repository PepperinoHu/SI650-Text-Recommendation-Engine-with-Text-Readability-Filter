{"id": "C2-1334", "contents": "Most hermeneutic fictionalists about some particular discourse hold that although we normally utter sentences within the discourse in a fictional spirit, we could, and perhaps sometimes do, use these sentences literally. For example, a mathematical fictionalist might hold that when we utter \u201cthere are prime numbers\u201d in ordinary contexts we mean this in a fictional spirit, but add that when we utter this sentence in the philosophy room we sometimes intend to speak literally. But one can at least imagine a different kind of hermeneutic fictionalism. Take the case of discourse about fictional characters. A name like \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 is first introduced for the purposes of story telling and for making claims internal to the story; for example, the claim that SpongeBob lives in a pineapple under the sea. But there is disagreement about the proper account of the use of names of fictional entities extrafictive, non-story-telling contexts, e.g. in \u201cSpongeBob is a better role model than Superman\u201d. Some philosophers hold that this \u2018extrafictive\u2019 use of fictional names shows that \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 has a reference outside the fiction (for example, that it refers to an abstract entity). Others hold that while \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 can be used meaningfully in such contexts, it is nonetheless, in such contexts, a mere non-referring empty name, alongside \u2018Zeus\u2019 and \u2018Vulcan\u2019. But we can imagine a third kind of view, according to which names of fictional characters are, as it were, only meaningful inside the fiction. Anyone attracted to such a view must tell some special story about seeming extrafictive truths (Brock 2002). Similarly, and returning to fictionalism, one can imagine a fictionalist about some discourse who denies that the relevant sentences even can be meaningfully used outside the pretense; who holds that the sentences only have pretense-uses.\nThe view may sound farfetched. But Yablo (1998) comes close to suggesting a view of this sort when he says, after having motivated fictionalism about the use of names of cities, that he does not know what it would be to use \u201cChicago exists\u201d more literally than he already does. Let us call the fictionalism according to which there is a literal use of the sentences in question with which the ordinary use contrasts use fictionalism; call the other meaning fictionalism. The distinction may correspond to Armour-Garb and Woodbridge\u2019s (2015) distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic pretense. Armour-Garb and Woodbridge say that what characterizes extrinsic pretense is that we could take the utterance made literally, whereas in cases of intrinsic pretense, \u201cthe pretense is integral to the utterance saying anything at all\u201d. Use fictionalism is arguably by far the more common doctrine. But it is worth mentioning meaning fictionalism as well, both because some fictionalists appear to endorse it, and because the distinction will be relevant to some of the arguments against fictionalism. Armour-Garb and Woodbridge call their own brand of fictionalism semantic and oppose what they call pragmatic accounts.\nThere are further distinctions in the general vicinity. Following Yablo (2001), one can distinguish between the following fictionalist views (about discourse about Xs):\nInstrumentalism: the speaker is not \u201creally\u201d asserting anything, only pretending to do so.\nMeta-fictionalism: the speaker is \u201creally\u201d asserting that according to a certain fiction, the Xs are so and so.\nObject-fictionalism: the speaker is \u201creally\u201d asserting that the world is in a certain condition, namely, the condition it needs to be in to make it true in the relevant fiction that the Xs are so and so.\nFiguralism: the speaker is \u201creally\u201d asserting that something is in a certain condition, but perhaps not the world; the Xs are functioning as representational aids in a figurative description of the Ys, where the Ys may themselves be representational aids invoked to help us describe still further objects.\nLet us take number discourse as our example, and consider these fictionalist views as applied to number discourse. The instrumentalist says that in an utterance of \u201cthe number of apples is two\u201d, the speaker is merely pretending to assert something; nothing is really asserted. The instrumentalist does not present an alternative account of what the speaker is doing. The metafictionalist says that something is asserted along the lines of: according to the number fiction, the number of apples is two. The object fictionalist says that what is asserted is something non-number-involving about the real world \u2014 something which would make it true in the fiction that the number of apples is two: that there is an apple x and an apple y such that x and y are distinct and nothing distinct from both x and y is an apple. The characteristic objects of the discourse, the numbers, are mere aids we use to make utterances about how things stand in the real world. Yablo\u2019s own preferred view, figuralism, is supposed to be a close cousin of object fictionalism, but with an added twist. Figuralism does not differ from object fictionalism in what it says about the example used so far. The differences only show up when we are considering utterances intuitively about these props themselves, the numbers, such as \u201c7 is smaller than 11\u201d. Sometimes, Yablo says, numbers \u2014 and other props \u2014 are used as mere representational aids, but sometimes they also function as things represented. (He provides as a comparison \u201cpinpricks of conscience register less than pangs of conscience.\u201d) In a typical utterance of \u201cthe number of apples is two\u201d, the number functions as a representational aid. But in \u201cthere are numbers\u201d as used by the platonist, numbers function as things represented. And in \u201cthe number of even primes is zero\u201d, as a nominalist can be envisaged to use it when doing philosophy, saying something that given her philosophical views is true, they function both as representational aids (\u201cnumber\u201d) and as things represented (\u201ceven prime\u201d).
