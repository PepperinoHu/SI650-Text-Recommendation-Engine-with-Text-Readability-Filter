In the meantime, he argues, we need better research into systems for navigation while children should be encouraged to learn how to find their way around by more traditional means. \u201cSchools should teach navigation and map reading as life skills,\u201d he wrote. \nAccording to Ofcom (the Office of Communications), around 66% of adults in the UK owned a smartphone in 2015, up from 39% in 2012, making GPS technology widely available. But McKinlay, a satellite communication and navigation consultant, believes that we should be wary of leaving our navigational needs to our devices. \u201cNavigation is a use-it-or-lose-it skill,\u201d he wrote. \nWhile few scientific studies have explored the issue, research from 2009 supports the notion. \u201cWhat we did was to look at a set of current London taxi drivers and a set of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years,\u201d said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers, head of the Spatial Cognition Group at University College London, who is an author of the study. The results showed that the retired taxi drivers performed worse on navigation tests than those still behind the wheel. \u201cWe were able to show that their abilities did drop away if they weren\u2019t using their knowledge on that particular test.\u201d \nSpiers also believes there is a danger in relying on technologies like GPS but he is quick to point out that the biggest risk lies in users being unwittingly led into perilous situations. Among the fatalities blamed on satnavs (satellite navigation devices) was the death of a driver who, in 2010, plunged into a reservoir in Spain. \u201cThere is a genuine potential for risk in relying on a satnav,\u201d said Spiers. \u201cBut the actual health risk of not using your brain effectively is not known.\u201d \nThe way in which navigational technology is used could also affect its impact on our own abilities, says Spiers. While audio instructions to drivers remove the need to think about navigation, he says, the use of smartphone apps as digital maps is very different. \u201cIn the old days, you had to print out or take an A to Z map in your pocket \u2013 what we are doing now is just using computer- aided information and you are having to think really quite hard about where you are going and interact with this device,\u201d he said. \u201cThe modern technology isn\u2019t just dumbing us down completely.\u201d \nMcKinlay remains convinced that navigation technologies have a long way to go before futuristic scenarios involving driverless cars and smart cities become a reality. \u201cFor really critical applications \u2013 safety applications like landing aircraft or navigating aircraft \u2013 GPS is still not good enough,\u201d he said. \nThough Spiers believes the development of artificial intelligence based on machine learning could lead to a new wave of navigational aids, McKinlay remains sceptical. \u201cWe will see ever- smarter machines which are very, very task specific, but the big breakthrough will be when they are able to tune in to what you might be thinking and what you might be wanting to achieve,\u201d he said. \nUltimately, McKinlay believes, it\u2019s essential that humans remain able to take control of their navigation. \u201cDo you really want to encourage people to get to a point where, when it disappears or when the battery goes flat, they are in total shock and can do nothing?\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology isn\u2019t magic \u2013 it is just a tool.\u201d"}
