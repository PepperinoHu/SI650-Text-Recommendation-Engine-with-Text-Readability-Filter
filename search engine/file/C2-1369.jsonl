{"id": "C2-1369", "contents": "Conceptual difficulties have plagued quantum mechanics since its inception, despite its extraordinary predictive successes. The basic problem, plainly put, is this: It is not at all clear what quantum mechanics is about. What, in fact, does quantum mechanics describe?\nIt might seem, since it is widely agreed that any quantum mechanical system is completely described by its wave function, that quantum mechanics is fundamentally about the behavior of wave functions. Quite naturally, no physicist wanted this to be true more than did Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, the father of the wave function. Nonetheless, Schr\u00f6dinger ultimately found this impossible to believe. His difficulty had little to do with the novelty of the wave function:\nThat it is an abstract, unintuitive mathematical construct is a scruple that almost always surfaces against new aids to thought and that carries no great message. (Schr\u00f6dinger [1935] 1980: 327)\nRather, it was that the \u201cblurring\u201d that the spread out character of the wave function suggests \u201caffects macroscopically tangible and visible things, for which the term \u2018blurring\u2019 seems simply wrong\u201d.\nFor example, in the same paper Schr\u00f6dinger noted that it may happen in radioactive decay that\nthe emerging particle is described \u2026 as a spherical wave \u2026 that impinges continuously on a surrounding luminescent screen over its full expanse. The screen however does not show a more or less constant uniform surface glow, but rather lights up at one instant at one spot \u2026. (Schr\u00f6dinger [1935] 1980: 327\u2013328)\nAnd he observed that one can easily arrange, for example by including a cat in the system, \u201cquite ridiculous cases\u201d with\nthe \u03c8-function of the entire system having in it the living and the dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal parts. (Schr\u00f6dinger [1935] 1980: 328)\nIt is thus because of the \u201cmeasurement problem\u201d, of macroscopic superpositions, that Schr\u00f6dinger found it difficult to regard the wave function as \u201crepresenting reality\u201d. But then what does? With evident disapproval, Schr\u00f6dinger observes that\nthe reigning doctrine rescues itself or us by having recourse to epistemology. We are told that no distinction is to be made between the state of a natural object and what I know about it, or perhaps better, what I can know about it if I go to some trouble. Actually\u2014so they say\u2014there is intrinsically only awareness, observation, measurement. (Schr\u00f6dinger [1935] 1980: 328)\nMany physicists pay lip service to the Copenhagen interpretation\u2014that quantum mechanics is fundamentally about observation or results of measurement. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to find any who, when pressed, will defend this interpretation. It seems clear that quantum mechanics is fundamentally about atoms and electrons, quarks and strings, not those particular macroscopic regularities associated with what we call measurements of the properties of these things. But if these entities are not somehow identified with the wave function itself\u2014and if talk of them is not merely shorthand for elaborate statements about measurements\u2014then where are they to be found in the quantum description?\nThere is, perhaps, a very simple reason why it is so difficult to discern in the quantum description the objects we believe quantum mechanics ought to describe. Perhaps the quantum mechanical description is not the whole story, a possibility most prominently associated with Albert Einstein. (For a general discussion of Einstein\u2019s scientific philosophy, and in particular of his approach to the conflicting positions of realism and positivism, see the entry on Einstein\u2019s philosophy of science.)\nIn 1935 Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen defended this possibility in their famous EPR paper. They concluded with this observation:\nWhile we have thus shown that the wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical reality, we left open the question of whether or not such a description exists. We believe, however, that such a theory is possible. (Einstein et al. 1935: 780)"}
