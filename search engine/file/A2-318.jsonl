I can't find any books on my research topic at my library.\nWhy don't you try a different library?\nI don't want to waste gas money.\nBut you might find your book.\nWhat library do you suggest?\nI suggest the one near my house.\nThat is way too far for me.\nThey have a lot of books. That library has never disappointed me.\nI have an idea! Why don't you borrow them for me?\nI don't know about that. What if you lose the books?\nI won't. I swear on my life.\nWow, you're so serious."}
