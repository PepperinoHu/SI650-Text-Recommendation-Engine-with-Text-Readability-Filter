{"id": "C2-1474", "contents": "\ufeffMargaret Thatcher, the most dominant British prime minister since Winston Churchill in 1940 and a global champion of the late 20th-century free market economic revival, has died. The British government announced that she would receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. \nThe British prime minister, David Cameron, who is cutting short his trip to Europe to return to London following the news, said: \u201cIt was with great sadness that l learned of Lady Thatcher\u2019s death. We\u2019ve lost a great leader, a great prime minister and a great Briton.\u201d He added: \u201cAs our first woman prime minister, Margaret Thatcher succeeded against all the odds, and the real thing about Margaret Thatcher is that she didn\u2019t just lead our country, she saved our country, and I believe she will go down as the greatest British peacetime prime minister.\u201d \nIn a statement, President Barack Obama said, \u201cHere in America, many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with President Reagan, reminding the world that we are not simply carried along by the currents of history \u2013 we can shape them with moral conviction, unyielding courage and iron will.\u201d \nThe first woman elected to lead a major western state, Lady Thatcher, as she became after the longest premiership since 1827, served 11 unbroken years at No 10 Downing Street. \nThatcher, who was 87, had been in declining health for some years, suffering from dementia. After a series of mini-strokes in 2002, Thatcher withdrew from public life, no longer able to make the kind of waspish pronouncements that had been her forte in office \u2013 and beyond. \nHer death was greeted with tributes from across the political spectrum. \nAs Labour sources announced the party would suspend campaigning in local elections as a mark of respect, its leader, Ed Miliband, said: \u201cShe will be remembered as a unique figure. She reshaped the politics of a whole generation. She was Britain\u2019s first woman prime minister. She moved the centre ground of British politics and was a huge figure on the world stage. The Labour Party disagreed with much of what she did and she will always remain a controversial figure. But we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength.\u201d \nThe deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said: \u201cMargaret Thatcher was one of the defining figures in modern British politics. Whatever side of the political debate you stand on, no one can deny that as prime minister she left a unique and lasting imprint on the country she served.\u201d \nDescribing her as a political phenomenon, the former Tory prime minister Sir John Major said: \u201cHer outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private.\u201d \nThe \u201cIron Lady\u201d proved a significant cold war ally of the US president Ronald Reagan in the final showdown with the Soviet Union, which broke up under reformist pressures led by Mikhail Gorbachev, a Kremlin leader with whom Thatcher famously declared she could \u201cdo business \u201d. As a result, many ordinary voters in ex-Soviet bloc states saw her as a bold champion of their liberty, a view widely shared across the spectrum of mainstream US opinion \u2013 though not at home or among key EU partners. \nThatcher was an unremarkable mid-ranking Conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975. Within a decade, she had become known around the world \u2013 both admired and detested \u2013 for her pro-market domestic reforms and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy, including her long-running battle with the IRA, which almost managed to murder her when it placed a bomb in the Grand Hotel, Brighton, in 1984. \nAt home, the emerging doctrine of Thatcherism meant denationalization of state-owned industry \u2013 the new word \u201cprivatization\u201d came into widespread use in many countries \u2013 and defeat of militant trade unionists, notably the National Union of Miners, whose year-long strike (1984 \u2013 85) was bitter and traumatic. \nBoosted by the newly arrived revenues from Britain\u2019s North Sea oil fields, Thatcher had room to manoeuvre and change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies \u2013 including moderate members of her own party. \nBut she also deployed her notorious \u201chandbaggings\u201d, or verbal attacks, in the European Union to obtain a British rebate \u2013 \u201cmy money\u201d as she called it. She was less successful in fending off the centralizing ambitions of the \u201cBelgian Empire\u201d, her description of the European Commission, especially in the years when it was headed by the French socialist Jacques Delors. \nHer allies in the tabloid press egged her on. And, as the British economy recovered from the severe recession that her monetarist medicine had inflicted on it \u2013 to tame the unions and cure inflation \u2013 she briefly seemed invincible. \nBut untrammelled power, with the defeat or retirement of allies who had kept her in check, led to mistakes and growing unpopularity. When Sir Geoffrey Howe, nominally her deputy, finally fell out with Thatcher \u2013 chiefly over Europe \u2013 his devastating resignation speech triggered a leadership challenge. Thatcher made way for John Major rather than risk losing to him in a ballot. \nIn retirement, she wrote highly successful memoirs in two volumes and campaigned energetically on behalf of the Thatcher Foundation, which sought to promote her values around the world."}
