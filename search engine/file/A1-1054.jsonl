I like basketball better.\nOh, okay. Do you have a cell phone?\nYes, why do you ask?\nCould you check to see who won the baseball game?\nSure, let me check. It'll take one minute. It looks like the Chicago Cubs won seven to three.\nYes! I was rooting for the Cubs.\nWell, they won. Glad I could be of some service.\nThanks again. Have a nice day."}
