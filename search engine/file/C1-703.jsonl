In the most senior roles, female directors received bonuses of \u00a336,270 over the past 12 months, compared with \u00a363,700 awarded to male directors. \nThe latest figures highlighting the inequitable nature of pay in British business led to calls for action from campaigners on workplace equality. Ann Francke, the CMI\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt\u2019s time to move this issue into the mainstream management agenda. \n\u201cThis is about changing our approach to management to allow for greater flexibility, less masculine cultures, more emphasis on outcomes rather than time in the office and greater transparency around performance and rewards. \u201cIn solving this issue, we would actually raise the performance of organizations and the well-being of individuals at work. What are we waiting for?\u201d Dr Ruth Sealy, a senior research fellow at Cranfield School of Management, added: \u201cIt is not surprising. Bonuses are a method of payment that can be used with discretion. As to what should be done about it, these things should be made more transparent.\u201d \nWhile statisticians warned that some of the data may be skewed by factors such as women entering occupations where there is less of a culture of bonus payments, the discrepancies in the sizes of awards do appear to be aggravating Britain\u2019s pay gap, which the government says is closing but still sees full-time male employees earn 10% more than women. \nMaria Miller, the Minister for Women and Equalities, said: \u201cThe CMI figures are yet another damaging example highlighting that, in the world of work, women still lose out to their male counterparts and that the playing field is far from level. \u201cChanges in the workplace are happening and it\u2019s good that the pay gap is closing \u2013 but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace. \n\u201cThe government is playing its part: we have made pay secrecy clauses illegal, given tribunals the power to force employers who break equal pay laws to carry out equal pay audits and signed 120 companies up to our Think, Act, Report scheme, which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit, promote and pay women. \u201cWe\u2019ve also looked at other pay gap causes, such as having to juggle work and family responsibilities, by introducing shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working to all employees.\u201d \nLarge companies such as Tesco, BT, Unilever and the international law firm Eversheds are among those signed up to Think, Act, Report. The scheme has only attracted 120 supporters in nearly two years of existence, having risen from 54 participants in November 2012. However, the CMI\u2019s data did provide some evidence to support Miller\u2019s contention that the overall pay gap is narrowing: the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses has appeared to shrink, decreasing from an average of \u00a310,060 in 2012 to \u00a38,502 in the CMI\u2019s most recent figures. However, the institute cautioned against direct comparisons between the 2012 and 2013 samples \u2013 which both polled around 40,000 managers \u2013 as they are not identical. \nA sub-set of 17,000 individual managers, whose salaries and bonuses have been tracked over a number of years, showed that male managers\u2019 earnings are rising faster than women\u2019s for the first time in five years, with men enjoying total increases of 3.2% compared with 2.8% for women, when salaries and bonuses are combined. \nAt the most senior level, male directors\u2019 earnings rose by 5.3% over the past 12 months, compared with just 1.1% for female directors."}
