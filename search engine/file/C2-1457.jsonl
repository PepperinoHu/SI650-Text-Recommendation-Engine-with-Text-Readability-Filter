{"id": "C2-1457", "contents": "Although in Western philosophy the earliest formulation of a version of the cosmological argument is found in Plato\u2019s Laws, 893\u201396, the classical argument is firmly rooted in Aristotle\u2019s Physics (VIII, 4\u20136) and Metaphysics (XII, 1\u20136). Islamic philosophy enriches the tradition, developing two types of arguments. Arabic philosophers (falasifa), such as Ibn Sina (c. 980\u20131037), developed the argument from contingency, which was taken up by Thomas Aquinas (1225\u201374) in his Summa Theologica (I,q.2,a.3) and in his Summa Contra Gentiles (I, 13). Influenced by John Philoponus (5th c) (Davidson 1969), the mutakallim\u016bm\u2014theologians who used reason and argumentation to support their revealed Islamic beliefs\u2014developed the temporal version of the argument from the impossibility of an infinite regress, now referred to as the kal\u0101m cosmological argument. For example, al-Gh\u0101z\u0101li (1058\u20131111) argued that everything that begins to exist requires a cause of its beginning. The world is composed of temporal phenomena preceded by other temporally-ordered phenomena. Since such a series of temporal phenomena cannot continue to infinity because an actual infinite is impossible, the world must have had a beginning and a cause of its existence, termed Allah or God (Craig 1979: part 1). This version of the cosmological argument entered the medieval Christian tradition through Bonaventure (1221\u201374) in his Sentences (II Sent. D.1,p.1,a.1,q.2).\nEnlightenment thinkers, such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Samuel Clarke, reaffirmed the cosmological argument. Leibniz (1646\u20131716) appealed to a strengthened principle of sufficient reason, according to which \u201cno fact can be real or existing and no statement true without a sufficient reason for its being so and not otherwise\u201d (Monadology, \u00a732). Leibniz uses the principle to argue that the sufficient reason for the \u201cseries of things comprehended in the universe of creatures\u201d (\u00a736) must exist outside this series of contingencies and is found in a necessary being that we call God. Samuel Clarke likewise employed the principle of sufficient reason in his cosmological argument (Rowe 1975: chap. 2).\nAlthough the cosmological argument does not figure prominently in Asian philosophy, a very abbreviated version of it, proceeding from dependence, can be found in Udayana\u2019s Ny\u0101yakusum\u0101\u00f1jali I,4. In general, philosophers in the Ny\u0101ya tradition argue that since the universe has parts that come into existence at one occasion and not another, it must have a cause. We could admit an infinite regress of causes if we had evidence for such, but lacking such evidence, God must exist as the non-dependent cause. Many of the objections to the argument contend that God is an inappropriate cause because of God\u2019s nature. For example, since God is immobile and has no body, he cannot properly be said to cause anything. The Naiy\u0101yikas reply that God could assume a body at certain times, and in any case, God need not create in the same way humans do (Potter 1977: 100\u201307).\nThe cosmological argument came under serious assault in the 18th century, first by David Hume and then by Immanuel Kant. Hume (1748) attacked both the view of causation presupposed in the argument (that causation is an objective, productive, necessary power relation that holds between two things) and the Causal Principle\u2014every contingent being has a cause of its existence\u2014that lies at the heart of the argument. Kant contended that the cosmological argument, in identifying the necessary being, relies on the ontological argument, which in turn is suspect. We will return to these criticisms below.\nBoth theists and nontheists in the last part of the 20th century and the first part of the 21st century generally show a healthy skepticism about the argument. Alvin Plantinga concludes \u201cthat this piece of natural theology is ineffective\u201d (1967: chap. 1). Richard Gale contends, in Kantian fashion, that since the conclusion of all versions of the cosmological argument invokes an impossibility, no cosmological arguments can provide examples of sound reasoning (1991: chap. 7). (However, Gale seems to have changed his mind and in recent writings proposed and defended his own version of the cosmological argument, which we will consider below.) Similarly, Michael Martin (1990: chap. 4), John Mackie (1982: chap. 5), Quentin Smith (Craig and Smith 1993), Bede Rundle (2004), Wes Morriston (2000, 2002a, 2003, 2010), and Graham Oppy (2006: chap. 3) reason that no current version of the cosmological argument is sound. Yet dissenting voices can be heard. Robert Koons (1997) employs mereology and modal and nonmonotonic logic in taking a \u201cnew look\u201d at the argument from contingency. In his widely discussed writings William Lane Craig marshals multidisciplinary evidence for the truth of the premises found in the kal\u0101m argument. Richard Gale and Alexander Pruss propose a new version based on a so-called weak principle of sufficient reason that leads to a finite God that is not omnibenevolent, and Richard Swinburne, though rejecting deductive versions of the cosmological argument, proposes an inductive argument that is part of a larger cumulative case for God\u2019s existence.\nThere is quite a chance that if there is a God he will make something of the finitude and complexity of a universe. It is very unlikely that a universe would exist uncaused, but rather more likely that God would exist uncaused. The existence of the universe\u2026can be made comprehensible if we suppose that it is brought about by God. (Swinburne 1979: 131\u201332)\nMore recently, Michael Almeida constructed a new version of the argument based on modal realism. In short, in contrast to the first half of the last century, contemporary philosophers contribute increasingly detailed, complex, and sophisticated arguments on both sides of the debate."}
