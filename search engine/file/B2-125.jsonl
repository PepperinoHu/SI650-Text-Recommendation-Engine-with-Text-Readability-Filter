For some, it\u2019s a welcome change from the unrelenting darkness of winter. But, for the small but growing Muslim community of Iqaluit, Nunavut, life in the land of the midnight sun poses a real challenge during the month of Ramadan, during which Muslims typically fast from sunrise to sunset. \n\u201cI haven\u2019t fainted once,\u201d said 29-year-old Abdul Karim, one of the few in the city who has carefully timed his Ramadan fast to the Arctic sun since moving from Ottawa in 2011. This year, that means eating at about 1.30am before the sun rises and breaking his fast at about 11pm when the sun sets. \u201cThe only reason to stop would be if it hurts my health,\u201d Karim said. Pointing to his sizable frame, he laughed as he added: \u201cBut, looking at my condition, I don\u2019t think fasting will hurt me.\u201d \nAs the end of Ramadan draws near for Muslims around the world, much of the holy month\u2019s focus on community work, prayer and reflection has been a constant in communities around the world. But in Iqaluit and the other Muslim communities in the Arctic, the long days have forced a shift in how the element of fasting is approached. \nMost in Iqaluit adhere to the timetable followed by Muslims in Ottawa, some 1,300 miles south of the city \u2013 following the advice of Muslim scholars who have said Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city. It still means fasting for some 18 hours a day, said Atif Jilani, who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s long days, but more manageable.\u201d \nMany in the 100-strong community break their fast together, gathering in the city\u2019s brand new mosque \u2013 completed in February amid temperatures that dropped as low as -50C with wind chill \u2013 for nightly suppers. As they tuck into traditional foods such as dates and goat or lamb curries, the sun shines brightly through the windows. \nIt\u2019s a scene that plays out across Canada\u2019s northernmost mosques during Ramadan, as Muslim communities wrestle with the country\u2019s unique geography. The 300 or so Muslims in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories, have several options when it comes to fasting during Ramadan, said Nazim Awan, president of the Yellowknife Islamic Centre, with exceptions made for those who are pregnant or ill. \u201cThere might be some superhumans who want to fast for 23 hours, but the other option is to follow the intent and spirit of fasting by following nearby cities or they can follow the times of Mecca and Medina.\u201d In recent years, much of the community has opted to follow the Ramadan timetable of Edmonton, in Alberta. Some, such as Awan \u2013 a father of two young children, including a 12-year-old who recently started fasting \u2013 follow the timings of Mecca. He hopes to encourage his son with the more manageable timetable of about 15 hours of fasting as compared with about 18 hours in Edmonton. \n\u201cIf I fast Yellowknife or Edmonton times, my son might say, 'Papa, you are really insane. What are you doing?'\u201d he said. Faced with the impossibility of following the local movements of the sun, the 100 or so Muslims in Inuvik, a small town that sits 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle, have also been following Edmonton\u2019s timetable. \u201cWe currently have 24 hours a day of sun,\u201d said Ahmad Alkhalaf. \u201cThere\u2019s no sunrise or sunset.\u201d \nThe adherence to Edmonton\u2019s schedule was already in place in 2001 when he moved from Toronto to the small northern community of 3,500 people. \u201cMy first Ramadan here was in December. There\u2019s no sun at that time; it\u2019s dark all day and night. So we used Edmonton time.\u201d At times, it can be psychologically challenging to follow the clock rather than what is happening outside, Alkhalaf said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to break your fast when it\u2019s dusk and we eat when the sun is out. It\u2019s not usual to have iftar [the meal breaking the fast] when the sun is up,\u201d he said. In Inuvik, where much of the population is Inuit, the Muslim community has sought to strike a balance between Ramadan and the local culture and traditions. The iftar meal includes dates and rich curries \u2013 as well as local game such as reindeer, prepared in accordance with Islamic law. \u201cWe make a soup or curry \u2026 but instead of using beef, we use reindeer.\u201d \nIn Iqaluit, as the Muslim community prepares to mark the end of Ramadan, some reflect that 2016\u2019s timing \u2013 stretching across some of the longest days of the year \u2013 has made it one of the more challenging of recent years. It\u2019s particularly true for those like Karim who have determinedly followed the local sunrise and sunset. But, his efforts will be rewarded years from now, said Karim, thanks to the lunar calendar. Ramadan will eventually fall during winter, which, in Iqaluit, sees the sun rise and set within a few hours each day. \u201cI\u2019ll follow those hours, too,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cOh yes, definitely.\u201d"}
