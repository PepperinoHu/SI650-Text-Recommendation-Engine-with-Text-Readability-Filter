Ask someone else.\nYou're so mean!\nI can't let anyone borrow my class notes.\nWhy not? They're just notes.\nI let a classmate borrow my notes once, and she sold copies to people.\nThat's crazy! For how much?\nShe sold each class note set for $5.\nDon't worry, I promise not to sell your notes.\nI can't take your word for it."}
