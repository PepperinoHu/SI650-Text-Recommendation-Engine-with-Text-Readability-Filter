For three-and-a-half years, all pupils at St Ninian\u2019s Primary have walked or run a mile each day. They do so at random times during the day, apparently happily, and, despite the rise in childhood obesity across the UK, none of the children at the school are overweight. \nThe daily mile has done so much to improve these children\u2019s fitness, behaviour and concentration in lessons that scores of nursery and primary schools across Britain are following suit and getting pupils to get up from their desks and take 15 minutes to walk or run round the school or local park. \nElaine Wyllie, headteacher of St Ninian\u2019s, said: \u201cI get at least two emails a day from other schools and local authorities asking how we do it. The thought of children across the country running every day because of something we\u2019ve done is phenomenal.\u201d \nOne in ten children are obese when they start school at the age of four or five, according to figures from the Health & Social Care Information Centre, and, in the summer of 2015, a study found that schoolchildren in England are the least fit they have ever been. Primary schools have therefore been quick to note the benefits of the daily mile. It has been introduced in schools in London, Gateshead, Wales and other parts of Scotland, while others are planning to launch the initiative during the 2015-6 academic year. In Stirling alone, 30 schools have already started or are to start the daily mile. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a common-sense approach to children\u2019s fitness, which is free and easy. The most important thing is that the children really enjoy it; otherwise, you couldn\u2019t sustain it. They come back in bright-eyed and rosy-cheeked, how children used to look. It\u2019s joyous to see,\u201d said Wyllie. At St Ninian\u2019s, teachers take their pupils out of lessons on to a specially built circuit around the school\u2019s playing field for their daily mile whenever it best suits that day\u2019s timetable. Only ice or very heavy rain stop them. \nThe extent of the benefits have yet to be determined but researchers from Stirling University have launched a comparative study to look for quantitative evidence of the physical, cognitive and emotional benefits of the daily mile. Dr Colin Moran, who is leading the study, said: \u201cThe children at St Ninian\u2019s don\u2019t seem to have problems with obesity; they seem happier and staff say they settle into lessons faster so we designed a study that would test all of these things. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence about the benefits but there aren\u2019t any scientific facts yet.\u201d St Ninian\u2019s pupils will be compared with children from another school in Stirling that has yet to start the scheme. \nKevin Clelland, a primary school teacher from Leeds, visited St Ninian\u2019s before convincing his colleagues it was a great idea. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s such a simple thing to do but seems to have such an amazing impact. We\u2019re really committed to improving the fitness of our pupils beyond the two-hour statutory PE that we are expected to deliver.\u201d His school is now constructing a track. \nActive Cheshire, a strategic body for sports and fitness in Cheshire and Warrington, is taking a group of senior figures from the local authority up to Scotland to assess the results of the daily mile. The hope is to introduce it across the 450 schools in the region if a pilot is successful. \nParalympian, Tanni Grey-Thompson, chair of ukactive, the UK\u2019s leading not-for-profit health body for physical activity, said: \u201cAll children need to achieve 60 active minutes every day, whether in a lesson, on the walk to school or in the playground. It\u2019s fantastic to see initiatives like the daily mile be established, showing real leadership from the education sector to improve children\u2019s fitness levels and their cognitive behaviour, and make a real difference to schools, teachers, parents and young people\u2019s lives. We know sitting still kills; not sitting still helps children build skills that will stay with them for life.\u201d \nThe Scottish government is also supportive. A spokesperson said: \u201cLearning in PE is enhanced by initiatives like the daily mile, which can encourage and support parents in fostering healthy habits with their children from a young age. We are pleased to see so many Scottish schools are taking part or planning to do so.\u201d"}
