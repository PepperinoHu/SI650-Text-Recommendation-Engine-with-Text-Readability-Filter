There's a restroom in the market across from us though.\nThat restroom is really dirty. It smells like someone died in there.\nFine, I'll take you to our restroom.\nYay! Thank you so much.\nWe have to go secretly. If anyone sees you use the restroom, I'll be fired.\nDon't worry. I will be small and quiet as a mouse.\nOkay, good. The password is 595. Go quickly before anyone sees you.\nThank you for your kindness.\nYou owe me if we ever see each other again."}
