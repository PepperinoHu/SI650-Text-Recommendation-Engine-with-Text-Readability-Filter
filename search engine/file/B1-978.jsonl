I just picked it up,\u201d Louise Haggerty, a 56-year-old hairdresser and waitress, said of her 1am trip to the Black Friday sales. \u201cIt was mental in there. It was crazy. It was absolutely disgusting, disgusting.\u201d \nHaggerty had ventured out to the 24-hour Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket in Harringay, north-east London with a friend in the hope of snapping up a bargain flat-screen TV. \u201cBut so many people pushed in the queue we didn\u2019t have a chance,\u201d she said. \u201cThe poor woman who was second in the queue was pushed out by a crowd of youths. She didn\u2019t get anything. People were behaving like animals \u2013 it was horrible,\u201d she said. \u201cI only saw two security guards.\u201d \nFrustrated with not being able to buy a Blaupunkt 40\u201d TV reduced from \u00a3299.99 to \u00a3149.99, Haggerty rushed to pick up a Dyson Animal Vac, down from \u00a3319.99 to \u00a3159.99. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how much it costs; I don\u2019t know even know if I\u2019m going to buy it. I just wanted something,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are lads in there with three, four, five tellies. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d \nOne of those lads was Andy Blackett, 30, an estate agent, who had two trolleys full of bargains. \u201cI got two coffee makers, two tablets, two TVs and a stereo,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you the prices but I know they\u2019re bargains.\u201d But his mate Henry Fischer, a 19-year-old student, wasn\u2019t as successful. \u201cSomeone snatched my telly from me \u2013 it\u2019s cos I\u2019m the smaller one.\u201d \nBlackett, Fischer and some mates had driven to Sainsbury\u2019s at 12.45am after retreating from the \u201cbedlam\u201d of Tesco\u2019s 24-hour Lea Valley supermarket, where the Black Friday sale started at midnight. \u201cTesco was scary so we came here instead,\u201d Blackett said. \nMore than a dozen police officers attended the Tesco store on Glover Drive, Upper Edmonton, as scuffles broke out between eager and frustrated shoppers. Customers were seen tearing down cardboard hoardings put in place to hold back sale items until the stroke of midnight. Tesco delayed the sale of its most popular sale items \u2013 TVs \u2013 for almost an hour until police brought the situation under control. One officer was overheard criticizing the manager for failing to ensure adequate security and suggested the sale should be suspended altogether. The Tesco store is across the road from an IKEA furniture store that was the scene of riots when it opened with a midnight sale in 2005. \nPolice intervened at other stores, including Tesco in Willesden and Surrey Quays, just before the doors opened at midnight. Greater Manchester Police said at least two people had been arrested at Black Friday sales events already that morning. The force said on its Twitter feed: \u201cKeep calm, people!\u201d South Wales Police also reported receiving a number of calls from staff at Tesco stores after they became \u201cconcerned due to the volume of people who had turned up to sale events\u201d. \nOne of the first purchasers of a flat-screen TV, when TV sales began just before 1am, was James Alled, 30, a businessman, who bought two and was already negotiating to sell one of them to someone further down the queue. \u201cI bought them for \u00a3250. I\u2019ll sell it to you for \u00a3350, \u00a3300 cash,\u201d he said. Further back in the queue, Christine Ball, 62, wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cI got here at 10.15pm and I\u2019m further back now than when I got here,\u201d she said. \u201cNone of that lot know what a queue is.\u201d \nBall, who, like most of the shoppers, had not heard of the US-inspired Black Friday sales until now, said she had come out especially to buy her grandson a TV for Christmas. \u201cNot one of those massive ones; just a normal one at \u00a3100 or so,\u201d she said. In her basket was a pint of semi-skimmed and a loaf of bread. \u201cTelly, milk and bread \u2013 the necessities,\u201d she said. \nMel Mehmet, 23, had been to Black Friday sales in 2013 and had expected queues but said the atmosphere in Tesco scared her this time. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, really, having it at midnight \u2013 the police must have more important things to do at night than be called to sales. We\u2019re going to PC World first thing \u2013 their sale starts at 8am.\u201d"}
