In the field of computer\nvision, it has become the workhorse for applications ranging from self-driving cars to surveillance and\nsecurity. Whereas, deep neural networks have demonstrated phenomenal success (often beyond human\ncapabilities) in solving complex problems, recent studies show that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks\nin the form of subtle perturbations to inputs that lead a model to predict incorrect outputs. For images,\nsuch perturbations are often too small to be perceptible, yet they completely fool the deep learning models.\nAdversarial attacks pose a serious threat to the success of deep learning in practice. This fact has recently\nled to a large influx of contributions in this direction. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on\nadversarial attacks on deep learning in computer vision. We review the works that design adversarial attacks,\nanalyze the existence of such attacks and propose defenses against them. To emphasize that adversarial\nattacks are possible in practical conditions, we separately review the contributions that evaluate adversarial\nattacks in the real-world scenarios. Finally, drawing on the reviewed literature, we provide a broader outlook\nof this research direction.\nINDEX TERMS Deep learning, adversarial perturbation, black-box attack, white-box attack, adversarial\nlearning, perturbation detection.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nDeep Learning [1] is providing major breakthroughs in solving the problems that have withstood many attempts of\nmachine learning and artificial intelligence community in\nthe past. As a result, it is currently being used to decipher\nhard scientific problems at an unprecedented scale, e.g. in\nreconstruction of brain circuits [2]; analysis of mutations in\nDNA [3]; prediction of structure-activity of potential drug\nmolecules [4], and analyzing the particle accelerator data [5]\n[6]. Deep neural networks have also become the preferred\nchoice to solve many challenging tasks in speech recognition [7] and natural language understanding [8].\nIn the field of Computer Vision, deep learning became the\ncenter of attention after Krizhevsky et al. [9] demonstrated the\nimpressive performance of a Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) [10] based model on a very challenging large-scale\nvisual recognition task [11] in 2012. A significant credit for\nthe current popularity of deep learning can also be attributed\nto this seminal work. Since 2012, the Computer Vision community has made numerous valuable contributions to deep\nlearning research, enabling it to provide solutions for the\nproblems encountered in medical science [21] to mobile\napplications [179]. The recent breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the form of tabula-rasa learning of AlphaGo\nZero [14] also owes a fair share to deep Residual Networks\n(ResNets) [15] that were originally proposed for the task of\nimage recognition.\nWith the continuous improvements of deep neural network\nmodels [15], [144], [166]; open access to efficient deep learning software libraries [175]\u2013[177]; and easy availability of\nhardware required to train complex models, deep learning\nis fast achieving the maturity to enter into safety and security critical applications, e.g. self driving cars [12], [180],\nsurveillance [13], maleware detection [34], [107], drones and\nrobotics [155], [178], and voice command recognition [7].\nWith the recent real-world developments like facial recognition ATM [181] and Face ID security on mobile phones [182],\nit is apparent that deep learning solutions, especially those\noriginating from Computer Vision problems are about to play\na major role in our day-to-day lives."}
