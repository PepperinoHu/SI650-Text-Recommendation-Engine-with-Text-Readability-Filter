Wolf sightings are so rare that the sighting of their faeces marks a good day, even for a seasoned tracker. \nBut it is getting easier. There are now an estimated 1,500 wolves in Poland. The number has doubled in 15 years. Wolves are \u2013 along with the brown bear, the lynx and the wolverine \u2013 Europe\u2019s last large predator carnivores. Conservationists from Britain, Germany and the Netherlands are beating a path here to find out how the country has saved this protected species, slandered even in fairy tales. \nBits of bone and hair protrude from the precious black faeces. \u201cIt ate a red deer,\u201d says the University of Warsaw biologist. \u201cIn my lab, I can tell you all about this wolf \u2013 not only its diet but its gender, sexual habits, age, state of health and family connections.\u201d \nDNA tests have established that Polish wolves are travellers. \u201cOne wolf reached the Netherlands, where unfortunately it was hit by a car. They have a tremendous range. They need space. The average territory required by a Polish pack is 250 sq km,\u201d said Mys\u0142ajek. \n\u201cIs there any prospect of our ever being able to reintroduce wolves to Scotland?\u201d asks student Alex Entwisle, 23, on a field trip to southern Poland from his college in the UK. The animal science students have spent the day observing droppings and paw prints in the spruce-clad Beskidy mountains of the Polish Carpathians. \nTheir hot discussion topic is whether to reintroduce wolves to the British Isles for the first time since the 18th century. \nAs the guest of a British charity, the Wolves and Humans Foundation, Mys\u0142ajek toured the Scottish Highlands in 2015 and took questions from villagers about the Polish experience. \u201cThe big difference between Scotland and Poland is that we eat pork. We do not have many sheep here. \n\u201cThe similarity is that we have a lot of animals \u2013 300,000 red deer and more than 800,000 roe deer. In Poland, we also have a massive overpopulation of wild boar \u2013 about 200,000 \u2013 and these are ravaging farmers\u2019 cereal crops. Here, wolves are part of the solution,\u201d he says. \nThe scientist, who is a familiar face on Polish television, says wolves are exceptional animals that are capable of moving up to 30km during a single hunt. \u201cThe Beskidy pack is a strong unit, eight or nine individuals. This year, we have recorded five cubs, two yearlings and two adults. \n\u201cWe track them using motion-activated cameras in the forest and by following their prints in the mud and snow. In each family group, only one pair reproduces, once a year. All pack members care for the young with solidarity and devotion.\u201d \nMys \u0142ajek, the son of a shepherd, is puzzled by wolves\u2019 bad reputation. \u201cWhy does one speak of a 'lone-wolf gunman'? Why did we have to have Little Red Riding Hood?\" \nHe is fascinated by these aloof canines who remained in the wild 33,000 years ago when others decided on a much more comfortable existence as domestic dogs. \nWolves are not pooches. Mys\u0142ajek says only scientific arguments \u2013 the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population \u2013 can save Europe\u2019s wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf. \u201cNatural predators balance the ecosystem. They keep herbivores in check, thus allowing trees to grow tall for birds to nest in.\u201d \nShoot the deer? \u201cIt is only a partial solution,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a diverse environment, you have the so-called 'landscape of fear', where herbivores no longer spend all day grazing on the tender riverside grass. They move away, as a precaution, to avoid being trapped by a predator. This gives the vegetation a chance.\u201d \nThe ban on wolf hunting in the western Carpathians came into force in 1995 and nationwide in Poland in 1998. There are now resident packs in virtually all the country\u2019s major forests. The predators coexist with humans rather than being fenced off, as they are in African safari parks. \nThe Polish government pays compensation for livestock killed by wolves. Mys\u0142ajek advises farmers on erecting electric fences. He has helped revive the use of two deterrents that, for reasons no one quite understands, wolves find particularly scary: red bunting (hung around sheep pens) and the bark of the fluffy white Tatra Mountain Sheepdog. \nThe survival and mobility of Poland\u2019s wolves has been helped by the country\u2019s belated infrastructure development. In 1989, when the communists relinquished power, Poland had only one motorway. Major road projects \u2013 requiring wildlife impact studies \u2013 began after Poland joined the European Union in 2004. The country now has one of the highest densities in the world of overhead crossings and underpasses for wild animals. \nAttitudes have also changed. \u201cFor many years, hunting was cultural. In 1975, there were fewer than 100 wolves in Poland. Beginning in the 1950s, hunting wolves had been encouraged by the authorities. They paid a reward for killing a wolf worth a month\u2019s salary. It was carnage.\u201d \nMys\u0142ajek says the improvement in Polish wolves\u2019 survival chances has been considerable but remains fragile. Packs are mobile across borders and hunting still goes on in neighbouring Russia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Slovakia. \nHe claims Poland\u2019s new government, elected in October 2015, is hostile to wolves. \u201cThe Environment Minister, Jan Szyszko, makes no secret of being a hunter. There are 120,000 licensed hunters in Poland and they are influential in parliament. \n\u201cThe hunters claim wolves are a pest and that there are 4,000 of them in Poland, which is a spurious figure based on an unscientific count. This government is capable of turning back the clock.\u201d \nBeing a wolf advocate is not easy. \u201cIt is not as if you can argue to the politicians that wolves are a big tourist attraction. Most tourists want to see the animals but wolves stay away from humans. They have a tremendously sensitive sense of smell.\u201d \nThe 12 British animal science students leave the Polish Carpathians without a wolf sighting; just photographs of paw prints and droppings. Entwisle is convinced that Scotland will never be able to match Poland\u2019s success. \n\u201cIt would be amazing for the environment to have them back because of the problem of too many deer. But it would just not be viable because of the roads and sheep. \n\u201cThere would be problems with farmers. We had our industrial revolution too long ago. We ruined it for ourselves. In Britain, we like predators to be far away and to watch them on television, said Entwisle."}
