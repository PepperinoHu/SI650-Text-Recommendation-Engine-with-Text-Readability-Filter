My earliest class is at 9 a.m.\nThat sounds amazing to me.\nHow do you stay awake in that class?\nBefore I go to class, I drink four cups of coffee and take a cold shower.\nInteresting routine. Does it work?\nKind of. It's better than not doing it at all.\nWhy are you taking that class?\nIt's only offered once a year, so I have to take it now.\nI hope the class is interesting, at least."}
