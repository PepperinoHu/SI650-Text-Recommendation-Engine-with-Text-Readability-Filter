{"id": "C2-1393", "contents": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s corruption trial resumes on Monday, when Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader will have to enter his plea to charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.\nInvolving secret recordings, media moguls, gifts of cigars and champagne and aides\u2019 betrayals, the three corruption cases have all the makings of a political thriller.\nWILL IT BRING HIM DOWN?\nNetanyahu has managed to stay in office throughout the investigations and three election campaigns - with a fourth election due on March 23.\nHe denies wrongdoing and a trial is likely to take years. He will fight to remain prime minister in March and possibly for years afterwards. If he wins, he could try to secure parliamentary immunity, or pass laws to exempt a serving prime minister from standing trial.\nHOW HAS HE REMAINED IN OFFICE?\nUnder Israeli law, a prime minister is under no obligation to stand down unless convicted. No other government minister is protected in this way, so there are legal and political reasons why Netanyahu wants to stay at the top.\nDO ISRAELIS CARE?\nYes. The corruption case has had a polarising impact on Israelis. Thousands of demonstrators gather weekly outside his official residence and across Israel under the banner of \u201cCrime Minister\u201d, demanding he quit.\nBut his right-wing voter base has stayed loyal. Supporters see the man they call King Bibi as strong on security and an influential voice for Israel abroad.\nWHAT ARE THE CHARGES?\nCASE 4000 alleges Netanyahu granted regulatory favours worth around 1.8 billion shekels (about $500 million) to telecommunications company Bezeq Telecom Israel. In return, prosecutors say, he sought positive coverage of himself and wife Sara on a news website controlled by the company\u2019s former chairman, Shaul Elovitch.\nIn this case, Netanyahu has been charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Elovitch and his wife, Iris, have been charged with bribery and obstruction of justice. The couple deny wrongdoing.\nCASE 1000, in which Netanyahu has been charged with fraud and breach of trust, centres on allegations that he and his wife wrongfully received almost 700,000 shekels worth of gifts from Arnon Milchan, a Hollywood producer and Israeli citizen, and Australian billionaire businessman James Packer.\nProsecutors said gifts included champagne and cigars and that Netanyahu helped Milchan with his business interests. Packer and Milchan face no charges.\nCASE 2000 alleges Netanyahu negotiated a deal with Arnon Mozes, owner of Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, for better coverage and that, in return, he offered legislation that would slow the growth of a rival newspaper. Netanyahu has been charged with fraud and breach of trust. Mozes has been charged with offering a bribe, and denies wrongdoing.\nWHAT DOES NETANYAHU SAY?\nNetanyahu says he is the victim of a politically orchestrated \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by the left and media to oust him from office, and that receiving gifts from friends is not against the law.\nCOULD HE GO TO JAIL?\nBribery charges carry a jail sentence of up to 10 years and/or a fine. Fraud and breach of trust carry a sentence of up to three years.\nWILL A VERDICT COME SOON?\nUnlikely. The trial could take years. But proceedings could be cut short if Netanyahu seeks a plea deal."}
