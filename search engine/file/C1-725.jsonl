City after city has banned indoor smoking but that\u2019s different because other cities don\u2019t attract tourist dollars by aggressively advertising a \u201clet the good times roll\u201d attitude, as New Orleans does. An indoor smoking ban here will have consequences as unique as New Orleans\u2019s cultural ecosystem itself. \nAs the Wall Street Journal recently reported, New Orleans city government has, since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, begun trying to turn down the volume a bit. With the support of neighbourhood groups, the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly, while, at the same time, fighting to implement a new \u201cnoise ordinance\u201d (read: music ordinance). \n\u201cThis is just the wrong time for them to have pursued something like this,\u201d complains bar- owner William Walker, who, for reasons of personal choice, hates the anti-smoking law. \u201cForcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension that\u2019s already there.\u201d \nMany of New Orleans\u2019s best bars and some of its live music spots are in relatively quiet residential neighbourhoods. This neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes New Orleans different and charming. Recently, though, this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of New Orleans\u2019s musical personality feels at stake. \nMartha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music. \u201cThe bar was one of the deciding factors in me buying the house so I won\u2019t ever complain about the noise,\u201d says Wood, who also manages a live-music bar which, following a series of noise issues in 2013 (including complaints about the loud smokers outside), became one of New Orleans\u2019s first ever bars legally disallowed from serving drinks to go. \u201cNow, any small infraction could get us shut down,\u201d says Wood. \u201cWe recently installed a smoke eater to help with the smoke because we can\u2019t open the doors at night because of the 'noise'.\u201d \nThe Maple Leaf club went smoke-free voluntarily in 2014 as did another club where artists had been demanding smoke-free nights. \u201cA lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so I wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesn\u2019t host music,\u201d says Zalia BeVille, manager of the All Ways Lounge, which went smoke-free in 2013 because, she says, \u201cThe horn players and the singers, they asked us for it.\u201d \nLuckily, All Ways has an outdoor patio, unlike Lost Love Lounge, whose owner, Geoff Douville, loves the ban \u2013 he\u2019d previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar financially viable. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city,\u201d says Douville. \u201cPeople act like I have that choice, as a business owner. But, if I make that rule, they walk down the block to a bar with smoking. So I need it to be uniformed across the board for everybody.\u201d \nMany small business owners also fear smoke- free revenue loss. Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and met the smoking ban before, in England. \u201cBack home in Coventry, every pub where I was a regular closed within a year of the smoking ban,\u201d remembers Timms of the UK\u2019s ban, begun in 2007. To avoid the same fate, he\u2019s spending money to build a patio. \nLost Love\u2019s Douville, though, feels the ban to be a great business opportunity. \u201cThe number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar, with our food, but would never come because they didn\u2019t want to smell like smoke for the next seven days \u2013 we\u2019re now an option for all those people.\u201d Nor does Douville worry about noise complaints like Walker does: \u201cNo court is gonna label a bar a 'nuisance' after the city has ratified a smoking ban that requires you to go outside!\u201d he says. \u201cI want to see a judge reconcile 'no loitering' with 'no smoking inside'.\u201d \nCouncilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced and pushed the ban, disagrees: \u201cThe responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their clientele respectful outside their establishment as well,\u201d she says. \u201cThe owners and bartenders need to tell them to go have a smoke but be respectful to their communities. The idea that we can\u2019t have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous. It can be a win-win. I think it\u2019s about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.\u201d \nCantrell does acknowledge the city\u2019s uniqueness in terms of a smoking ban. \u201cHow is New Orleans different from the rest of the country? New Orleans is known as 'the City that Care Forgot',\u201d she says. \u201cNew Orleans needs to stand up and say 'We care about our people'. The most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions, these citizens are the backbone of our hospitality industry, which drives the economy in the state of Louisiana.\u201d She adds, \u201cNew Orleans is also unlike other places because you do have the option of taking your drink outside with you when you go out to smoke.\u201d \nMany worried that the already strained New Orleans Police Department didn\u2019t need any part in policing smokers. So the health department will handle bar warnings and fines. Bar customers are encouraged to \u201ccome fill out a form or call 311 and to include date-and-time-stamped photographs documenting illegal smoking\u201d. For this reason alone, Neil Timms says he\u2019ll comply with the ban: \u201cI don\u2019t want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo of \u2019em and gets beaten up.\u201d \nUnworried, Geoff Douville says that he\u2019s used to noise complaints by now so bring on the ban. \u201cWatch: the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now are gonna be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban to begin with.\u201d In the end, Douville shares Cantrell\u2019s win-win optimism. \u201cOf course they\u2019re gonna complain,\u201d he accepts. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re gonna win.\u201d"}
