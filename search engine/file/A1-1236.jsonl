That's ridiculous.\nLike you said, it's popular.\nI have to think about it then.\nI personally think $1 is nothing. It's cheaper than buying the book.\nHow much is the book?\nOn the back, it says it's $15. It depends on the bookstore you go to though.\nFine, I'll give you a $1.\nYou won't regret it! The book is really good."}
