I thought the borrowing time was two weeks.\nThat's for books only.\nOh, that's weird.\nWell, it doesn't take that long to finish a magazine.\nI know, but I like to take my time.\nI don't make the rules. Would you like to check it out?\nYes, I'd like to check it out.\nInteresting magazine choice. Reading about celebrities is not really smart of you.\nDon't judge me. I can't read educational stuff all the time.\nI do! I read Time and National Geographic.\nEveryone's taste is different."}
