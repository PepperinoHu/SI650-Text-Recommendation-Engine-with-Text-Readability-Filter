In an article for Index on Censorship, Pullman, who is president of the Society of Authors, makes a robust defence of copyright laws. He is highly critical of internet users who think it is OK to download music or books without paying for them. \n\u201cThe technical brilliance is so dazzling that people can\u2019t see the moral squalor of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt is outrageous that anyone can steal an artist\u2019s work and get away with it. It is theft, as surely as reaching into someone\u2019s pocket and taking their wallet is theft.\u201d \nHis article comes after music industry leaders met British Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street, where the issue of web piracy was discussed. \nPullman, writer of the His Dark Materials trilogy, says authors and musicians work in poverty and obscurity for years to bring their work to the level \u201cthat gives delight to their audiences and, as soon as they achieve that, the possibility of making a living from it is taken away from them\u201d. He concludes: \u201cThe principle is simple, and unaltered by technology, science or magic: if we want to enjoy the work that someone does, we should pay for it.\u201d \nPullman is writing in the next issue of the campaign group\u2019s magazine in a dialogue with Cathy Casserly, chief executive of Creative Commons, which offers open content licences \u201cthat lets creators take copyright into their own hands\u201d. Casserly argues that there is much wrong with copyright, which was created \u201cin an analogue age\u201d. She writes: \u201cBy default, copyright closes the door on countless ways that people can share, build upon and remix each other\u2019s work, possibilities that were unimaginable when those laws were established.\u201d \nShe says artists need to think creatively about how they distribute and monetize their work, quoting the science fiction writer Cory Doctorow, who said: \u201cMy problem is not piracy, it\u2019s obscurity.\u201d \nIndex on Censorship agrees. The magazine\u2019s editor, Rachael Jolley, said: \u201cExisting copyright laws don\u2019t work in the digital age and risk criminalizing consumers. We need new models for how artists, writers and musicians earn a living from their work.\u201d \nThe debate is a lively one and the scale of illegal downloading vast. Data collected by Ofcom (the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries) suggests that, between November 2012 and January 2013 in the UK, 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated, along with 52 million TV shows, 29 million films, 18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files. \nOfcom has said 18% of internet users aged over 12 admit to having recently pirated content, and 9% say they fear getting caught. Pullman writes in his article: \u201cThe ease and swiftness with which music can be acquired in the form of MP3 downloads is still astonishing to those of us who have been building up our iTunes list for some time.\u201d \nOne thing to emerge from the Downing Street meeting was Cameron\u2019s appointment of the Conservative MP Mike Weatherley to be his adviser on the subject. A spokesman for the BPI, the record industry trade body, said: \u201cMike Weatherley is a strong champion of copyright and the artists and creative producers it\u2019s there to protect. We hope his influence and the prime minister\u2019s endorsement of copyright will be brought to bear on the approach of the UK\u2019s intellectual property office.\u201d"}
