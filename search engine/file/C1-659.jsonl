{"id": "C1-659", "contents": "\ufeffWhen two islanders spotted a small fibreglass boat washed up on a remote Pacific atoll, they decided to take a closer look. What they found inside was a tale of adventure and unlikely survival to rival the blockbuster book and film Life of Pi: an emaciated man with long hair and a beard, who claimed to have been drifting for 16 months after setting out from Mexico, more than 12,500km away. \nThe man, dressed only in a ragged pair of underpants, told his rescuers that he had been adrift in the 7.3-metre fibreglass boat, whose engines were missing their propellers, since he left Mexico for El Salvador in September 2012. A companion had died at sea several months earlier, he said. \n\u201cHis condition isn\u2019t good, but he\u2019s getting better,\u201d said Ola Fjeldstad, a Norwegian anthropology student doing research on the isolated Ebon Atoll, part of the Marshall Islands archipelago. The man had said his name was Jos\u00e9 Ivan and he had indicated that he survived by catching turtles and birds with his bare hands, but, because he spoke only Spanish, further details were sketchy. There was no fishing equipment on the boat, but a turtle was inside when it washed up. \u201cThe boat is really scratched up and looks like it has been in the water for a long time,\u201d Fjeldstad told reporters. \nAccording to the researcher, the islanders who found the man took him to the main island in the atoll \u2013 which is so remote it has only one phone line and no internet \u2013 to meet the mayor, Ione de Brum, who contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Majuro, the Marshall Islands capital. Officials at the ministry said that they were awaiting more details and expected the man to be taken to the capital. \nThe government airline\u2019s only plane that can land at Ebon is currently undergoing maintenance and is not expected to return to service for several days. Officials are considering sending a boat to pick up the castaway. \u201cHe\u2019s staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him,\u201d said Fjeldstad, who added that the man had a basic health check and was found to have low blood pressure, but did not appear to have any life-threatening conditions and was able to walk with the aid of men on the island. \u201cWe\u2019ve been giving him a lot of water and he\u2019s gaining strength.\u201d \nFraser Christian, who teaches maritime survival courses at his Coastal Survival School in Dorset, said the man\u2019s story, if true, would be remarkable but far from unique. It was entirely possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand, he said, since \u201cthey are inquisitive and they will approach a small boat to shelter underneath it\u201d. Christian advises clients who find themselves forced to eat turtles to start with their eyes \u2013 \u201clots of fluid\u201d \u2013 then move on to the blood. \nhe major problems the man would have faced were exposure and dehydration. \u201cThe basic rule is: no water, no food. You need water to digest protein. If you have no fresh water and it doesn\u2019t rain for a few days, so you can\u2019t collect rainwater, you have basically had it.\u201d Individual physiology also plays a part, he said, with some people better suited to survival than others. \u201cThe mental thing is key and that\u2019s often down to people\u2019s situation in life and how used they are to dealing mentally with hardship.\u201d \nStories of survival in the vast Pacific Ocean are not uncommon. In 2006, three Mexicans made international headlines when they were discovered drifting, also in a small fibreglass boat near the Marshall Islands. They claimed to have survived for nine months at sea on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds, with their hope kept alive by reading the Bible. But Cliff Downing, who teaches sea survival to sailors, said he was sceptical about the latest tale. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t sound right to me. There are 1,001 hazards that would make his survival for so long very unlikely. One would want to know a lot more.\u201d \nMore castaways: Poon Lim, a Chinese sailor from a British ship sunk by a German submarine in 1942, survived 133 days on a wooden raft floating in the South Atlantic before being rescued by Brazilian fishermen. In 1971, experienced Scottish sailor Dougal Robertson and his family were sailing to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands from Panama when their boat was sunk by killer whales. They survived 38 days on a lifeboat before being rescued by a passing fishing trawler. \nIn 2006, three Mexican fishermen were discovered drifting in a small boat near the Marshall Islands, nine months after setting out on a shark-fishing expedition. They apparently survived on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds. Before being rescued by the US coastguard, the men stayed alive by eating tuna. A Panamanian fisherman sued Princess Cruises in 2012 after one of their ships ignored cries for help from him and two companions who were stranded in their broken boat. He survived 28 days adrift, but his friends both died of thirst."}
