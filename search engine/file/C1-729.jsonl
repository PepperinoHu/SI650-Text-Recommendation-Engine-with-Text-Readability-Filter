The data look absolutely gorgeous, and Pluto and Charon are just mind-blowing.\u201d \nOne of the biggest surprises was the discovery that \u201cthere are mountains in the Kuiper belt \u201d, the solar system\u2019s mysterious \u201cthird zone\u201d where Pluto sits amid around 100,000 smaller icy objects. John Spencer, a mission scientist, said the mountains appear to be around 11,000ft high and several hundred miles across. \u201cThese are pretty significant mountains.\u201d \nThe detailed image of one edge of the dwarf planet showed not a single crater, hinting that the surface has been recently \u201cpaved over\u201d by geological activity, which could include dramatic geysers blasting plumes of ice into the atmosphere or cryo-volcanoes that erupt in explosions of ice rather than molten rock. \nIn a nod to Pluto\u2019s former status as the ninth planet, until it was downgraded to a dwarf planet in 2006, the NASA press conference began with a rundown of spectacular images of the sun and the eight official planets. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought what was previously a blurred point of light into focus,\u201d said Dwayne Brown, NASA spokesman, as scientists and journalists waited for the image to be unveiled. \nStern described the images as \u201cjust skimming the surface\u201d of what would be learnt about the planet during the coming year. They have already produced some surprises. Scientists believe the mountains are made from water ice with just a thin veneer of \u201cexotic\u201d ices, methane and nitrogen. \u201cYou can\u2019t make mountains out of methane and nitrogen,\u201d said Spencer. \n\u201cWater ice is strong enough to hold up big mountains and that\u2019s what we think we\u2019re seeing here. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen this. The methane and nitrogen are just a coating.\u201d The mountains on Pluto are likely to have formed no more than 100m years ago \u2013 extremely recently given the 4.56bn-year-old solar system. This suggests the close-up region, which covers about 1% of Pluto\u2019s surface, may still be geologically active. The images are the first to show ice mountains outside of the moons of giant planets and raises the question of what kind of geological process could be generating the mountainous landscape. \nThe structures, together with the smoothness of Pluto\u2019s surface, suggest that geological activity is taking place and smoothing over depressions caused by asteroid impacts. Scientists believe this \u201cpaving\u201d process could be the result of internal heat that softens rock and ice or from snowfalls that cover the surface. For scale, the images are so detailed that, if the craft were flying over London, we would be able to pick out the runways at Heathrow airport. \nThe distance to Pluto \u2013 5bn km \u2013 means it takes New Horizons hours to send back a single picture and it will take 16 months to send all the data it has accumulated during the fly-by. The team also announced that the heart-shaped feature visible on Pluto will now be known as the Tombaugh Regio, in honour of Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the dwarf planet in 1930. \nThe new view of Charon reveals a varied, complex terrain. An area of cliffs and troughs stretching about 1,000km suggests widespread fracturing of Charon\u2019s surface, which could also be the result of geological activity. The image also shows a dramatic canyon estimated to be 7 to 9km deep. \nCathy Olkin, a mission scientist, said: \u201cCharon just blew our socks off when we had the new image today. The team has just been abuzz. \nThere is so much interesting science in this one image alone.\u201d Pluto is thought to be composed of about two thirds rock encased in a lot of ice, with surface temperatures of about minus 230C. As the \u00a3460m mission travels onwards into the Kuiper belt, scientists hope that it will open up a window on the ancient solar system and the origins of planets, potentially helping to explain the formation of the Earth itself. \nAndrew Coates, head of planetary science at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said: \u201cThese Kuiper belt objects are the building blocks of the outer solar system. They\u2019re all very cold \u2013 it\u2019s like a cosmic deep freeze. It\u2019s the best way of preserving solar system history. That is what is so fascinating about this. It\u2019s a really thrilling time for solar system exploration.\u201d \nIn August 2015, mission scientists will choose which of two objects to visit next. NASA estimates that the spacecraft will be able to keep recording and transmitting until the mid-2030s. Then, its plutonium power source will run out and it will shut down, drifting outwards towards the edge of the solar system and deep space beyond. \nNew Horizons also observed the smaller members of the Pluto system, which includes four other moons: Nix, Hydra, Styx and Kerberos. A new sneak-peek image of Hydra is the first to reveal its apparent irregular shape and its size, estimated to be about 43 by 33km. \u201cNew Horizons is a true mission of exploration, showing us why basic scientific research is so important,\u201d said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate. \n\u201cThe mission has had nine years to build expectations about what we would see during closest approach to Pluto and Charon. Today, we get the first sampling of the scientific treasure collected during those critical moments and I can tell you it dramatically surpasses those high expectations.\u201d \nThe observations also indicate Hydra\u2019s surface is probably coated with water ice. Future images will reveal more clues about the formation of this, and the other moon, billions of years ago."}
