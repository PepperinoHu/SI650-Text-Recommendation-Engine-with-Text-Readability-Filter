The announcement was made jointly by Carney and the artist Tracey Emin, who grew up in the town. \nCarney said it had been \u201cso important to get this right and have a proper process that involved the public,\u201d adding that, far from banknotes being purely a practical necessity, \u201cif done properly, they can be a piece of art in everyone\u2019s pocket\u201d. \n\u201cMoney is memory for a country and its people,\u201d said the Bank of England governor. \u201cBanknotes of the Bank of England are a celebration of the UK\u2019s heritage, a salute to its culture, a testament to its great achievements, including those of its most notable citizens. In short, money has not just economic value, it has cultural value as well. \n\u201cTurner is arguably the single most influential British artist of all time. His work was transformative and endures today. And his work will now feature on another 2bn works of art \u2013 our new \u00a320 notes.\u201d \n\u201cThe fact that we will have Turner on the \u00a320 note shows now that the British people are a nation of people who appreciate creativity and appreciate the arts,\u201d said Emin. \nThe note will feature Turner\u2019s 1799 self-portrait, which currently hangs in Tate Britain, as well as one of his most recognizable works, The Fighting Temeraire, a tribute to the ship that played a distinguished role in Nelson\u2019s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. \nEmblazoned on the note will also be a quote from the artist \u2013 \u201clight is therefore colour\u201d \u2013 as well as his signature, taken from his will, in which he bequeathed many of his works to the nation. \nThe new \u00a320 note, which replaces the one featuring social philosopher and economic theorist Adam Smith, will enter circulation by 2020. This is the first time the public have been given a say over whose face appears on a British banknote."}
