Your books are over the due date by one month.\nIt would have been longer if there wasn't a hold on my record.\nWhat kind of hold is on your record?\nA hold that won't let me go to the college football game.\nOh, that's tough.\nYeah. My girlfriend is actually a cheerleader, and so I have to go.\nYou're not going to like what I'm going to say.\nWhat is it?\nI can't remove the hold even if you pay the overdue fee.\nIs it a technical error?\nI don't know!
