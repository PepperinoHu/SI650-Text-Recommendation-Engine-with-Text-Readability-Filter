Humanity\u2019s first steps into the digital world could be lost to future historians, Vint Cerf told the American Association for the Advancement of Science\u2019s annual meeting in San Jose, California, warning that we faced a \u201cforgotten generation or even a forgotten century\u201d through what he called \u201cbit rot\u201d, where old computer files become useless junk. \nCerf called for the development of \u201cdigital vellum\u201d to preserve old software and hardware so that out-of-date files could be recovered no matter how old they are. \u201cWhen you think about the quantity of documentation from our daily lives that is captured in digital form, like our interactions by email, people\u2019s tweets and all of the world wide web, it\u2019s clear that we stand to lose an awful lot of our history,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our digital lives to fade away. If we want to preserve them, we need to make sure that the digital objects we create today can still be rendered far into the future,\u201d he added. \nWhat is 'bit rot' and is Vint Cerf right to be worried? Being able to access digital content in the coming decades could be less of an issue than one of the 'fathers of the internet' has implied. The warning highlights an irony at the heart of modern technology, where music, photos, letters and other documents are digitized in the hope of ensuring their long-term survival. But, while researchers are making progress in storing digital files for centuries, the programs and hardware needed to make sense of the files are continually falling out of use. \n\u201cWe are nonchalantly throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realizing it. We digitize things because we think we will preserve them but what we don\u2019t understand is that, unless we take other steps, those digital versions may not be any better, and may even be worse, than the artefacts that we digitized,\u201d Cerf says. \u201cIf there are photos you really care about, print them out.\u201d \nAncient civilizations suffered no such problems because histories written in cuneiform on baked clay tablets or rolled papyrus scrolls needed only eyes to read them. To study today\u2019s culture, future scholars would be faced with PDFs, Word documents and hundreds of other file types that can only be interpreted with dedicated software and sometimes hardware, too. \nThe problem is already here. In the 1980s, it was routine to save documents on floppy disks, upload Jet Set Willy from cassette to the ZX spectrum, slaughter aliens with a Quickfire II joystick and have Atari games cartridges in the attic. Even if the disks and cassettes are in good condition, the equipment needed to run them is now mostly found only in museums. \nThe rise of gaming has its own place in the story of digital culture but Cerf warns that important political and historical documents will also be lost to bit rot. In 2005, American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote Team of Rivals: the Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, describing how Lincoln hired those who ran against him for presidency. She went to libraries around the US, found the physical letters of the people involved and reconstructed their conversations. \u201cIn today\u2019s world, those letters would be emails and the chances of finding them will be vanishingly small one hundred years from now,\u201d said Cerf. \nHe concedes that historians will take steps to preserve material considered important by today\u2019s standards but argues that the significance of documents and correspondence is often not fully appreciated until hundreds of years later. Historians have learned how the greatest mathematician of antiquity considered the concept of infinity and anticipated calculus in 3BC after the Archimedes palimpsest was found hidden under the words of a Byzantine prayer book from the thirteenth century. \u201cWe\u2019ve been surprised by what we\u2019ve learned from objects that have been preserved purely by chance that give us insights into an earlier civilization,\u201d he said. \nResearchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh have made headway towards a solution to bit rot, or at least a partial one. There, Mahadev Satyanarayanan takes digital snapshots of computer hard drives while they run different software programs. These can then be uploaded to a computer that mimics the one the software ran on. The result is a computer that can read otherwise defunct files. Under a project called Olive, the researchers have archived Mystery House, the original 1982 graphic adventure game for the Apple II, an early version of WordPerfect, and Doom, the original 1993 first person shooter game. \nInventing new technology is only half the battle, though. More difficult still could be navigating the legal permissions to copy and store software before it dies. When IT companies go out of business, or stop supporting their products, they may sell the rights on, making it a nightmarish task to get approval. \u201cTo do this properly, the rights of preservation might need to be incorporated into our thinking about things like copyright and patents and licensing. We\u2019re talking about preserving them for hundreds to thousands of years,\u201d said Cerf."}
