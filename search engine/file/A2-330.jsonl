Then, when I sat in the garden to eat, I noticed two enormous brown eyes looking at me.\n5 . They belonged to a large white dog I had never seen before.\n4 . Feeling frightened, I tried to smile and said \u2018Hello boy\u2019.\n6. The dog heard this and jumped onto the chair next to me, smelt my eggs and started to eat.\n2. Deciding to forget my breakfast, I watched it eat everything while I quietly drank my coffee."}
