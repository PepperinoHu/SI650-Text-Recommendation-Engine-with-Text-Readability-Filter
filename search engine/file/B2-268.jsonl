Staff believe that in the middle of the night, while the aquarium was deserted, Inky clambered to the top of his glass enclosure, down the side of the tank and travelled across the floor of the aquarium. \nRob Yarrell, national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, said: \u201cOctopuses are famous escape artists. I don\u2019t think he was unhappy with us, or lonely, as octopuses are solitary creatures. But, he is such a curious boy. He would want to know what\u2019s happening on the outside. That\u2019s just his personality.\u201d \nOne theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium floor \u2013 a journey of three or four metres \u2013 and then, sensing freedom was at hand, into a drainpipe that led directly to the sea. The drainpipe was 50 metres long and opened onto the waters of Hawke\u2019s Bay, on the east coast of New Zealand\u2019s North Island. \nAnother possible escape route could have involved Inky squeezing into an open pipe at the top of his tank, which led under the floor to the drain. \u201cWhen we came in the next morning and his tank was empty, I was really surprised,\u201d said Yarrell, who has not launched a search for Inky. \u201cThe staff and I have been pretty sad. But then, this is Inky and he\u2019s always been a bit of a surprise octopus.\u201d \nReiss Jenkinson, exhibits keeper at the National Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain Inky had not been taken. \u201cI understand the nature of octopus behaviour very well,\u201d he said. \u201cI have seen octopuses on boats slip through bilge pumps. And, the security here is too tight for anyone to take Inky and why would they?\u201d \nBecause octopuses have no bones, they are able to fit into extremely small spaces and have been filmed squeezing through gaps the size of coins. They are also understood to be extremely intelligent and capable of using tools. At the Island Bay Marine Education Centre in Wellington, an octopus was found to be in the habit of visiting another tank overnight to steal crabs, then returning to its own. Another at the centre, Ozymandias, was thought to have broken a world record for opening a jar before it was released into the ocean. \nInky was brought to the National Aquarium a number of years ago by a local fisherman who found him caught in a crayfish pot. He was scarred and \u201crough looking\u201d, with shortened limbs, said Yarrell. \u201cHe had been living on the reef and fighting with fish so he wasn\u2019t in the best shape.\u201d According to Yarrell, Inky \u2013 who is about the size of a rugby ball \u2013 was an \u201cunusually intelligent\u201d octopus. \u201cHe was very friendly, very inquisitive and a popular attraction here. We have another octopus, Blotchy, but he is smaller than Inky and Inky had the personality.\u201d \nThe aquarium has no plans to step up security as a result of the escape as Inky was a \u201cone- off\u201d but the staff are \u201cincreasingly aware of what octopuses can actually do\u201d. Although the aquarium is not actively searching for a replacement for Inky, if a fisherman brought in another octopus, it might be willing to take it on. \u201cYou never know,\u201d said Yarrell. \u201cThere\u2019s always a chance Inky could come home to us.\u201d"}
