Researchers in Britain and the Netherlands have made a breakthrough, developing a method with a success rate in tests of over 70% that could be in use in police stations around the world within a decade. Rather than relying on facial tics, talking too much or waving of arms \u2013 all seen as tell-tale signs of lying \u2013 the new method involves monitoring full-body motions to provide an indicator of signs of guilty feelings. \nThe polygraph is widely used in the US in criminal and other cases and for security clearance for the FBI and CIA but is much less popular in Europe. There has been a lot of scepticism in the scientific and legal communities about its reliability. By contrast, the new method developed by the researchers has performed well in experiments. \nThe basic premise is that liars fidget more and so the use of an all-body motion suit \u2013 the kind used in films to create computer-generated characters \u2013 will pick this up. The suit contains 17 sensors that register movement up to 120 times per second in three dimensions for 23 joints. \nOne of the research team, Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, said: \u201cDecades of deception research show that the interviewer will tell truth from lies only slightly better than random, about 55 out of 100. \n\u201cThe polygraph has been around since the 1920s and, by measuring physiological stress induced by anxiety, you can get to 60. However, it can easily be abused as an interrogation prop and many people are anxious anyway facing a polygraph on which their job or liberty depends.\u201d \nHe said the new method, by contrast, achieved a reliability rating of over 70% and he was confident they would be able to do better. In some tests, the team has already achieved more than 80%. Anderson said: \u201cThe takeaway message is that guilty people fidget more and we can measure this robustly.\u201d \nAnderson added that the research had a special significance at this time, against the background of the US Senate report on torture by the CIA. Apart from the moral case against torture, Anderson pointed out that it was a very unreliable way of gathering accurate information. \u201cWe have known for a long time that torture does not work,\u201d he said. The new method offers a pragmatic, scientifically backed alternative to conducting interviews. The research paper was written by Dr Sophie van der Zee of Cambridge University, Professor Ronald Poppe of Utrecht University, Professor Paul Taylor of Lancaster University and Anderson. \nThe polygraph was created in 1921 by policeman John Larson, based on research by the psychologist William Marston. It records changes in pulse, blood pressure, sweating and breathing to ascertain whether a subject is lying. \nWhile cinema depictions suggest the device is near-infallible, the US Supreme Court ruled, in 1998, that there was no consensus that the polygraph was reliable, a finding supported by the US National Academy of Scientists in 2003. The experiment carried out by Anderson and his colleagues involved 180 students and employees at Lancaster University, of which half were told to tell the truth and half to lie. They were each paid \u00a37.50 for their participation in the 70-minute experiment, involving two tests. \nSome were interviewed about a computer game Never End , which they played for seven minutes, while others lied about playing it, having only been shown notes about it. \nThe second test involved a lost wallet containing \u00a35. Some were asked to bring the wallet to a lost-and-found box while others hid it and lied about it. \n\u201cOverall, we correctly classified 82.2% (truths: 88.9%; lies: 75.6%) of the interviewees as either being truthful or deceptive based on the combined movement in their individual limbs,\u201d the report says. Anderson said: \u201cOur first attempt looked at the extent to which different body parts and body signals indicated deception. It turned out that liars wave their arms more but, again, this is only at the 60% level that you can get from a conventional polygraph. \n\u201cThe pay dirt was when we considered total body motion. That turns out to tell truth from lies over 70% of the time and we believe it can be improved still further by combining it with optimal questioning techniques.\u201d \nAnother advantage is that total body motion is relatively unaffected by cultural background, anxiety and cognitive load (how much you are thinking), which confound other lie-detection technologies, Anderson said. \nThe use of all-body suits is expensive \u2013 they cost about \u00a330,000 \u2013 and can be uncomfortable, and Anderson and his colleagues are now looking at low-cost alternatives. These include using motion-sensing technology from computer games, such as the Kinect devices developed by Microsoft for the Xbox console. \nAnderson acknowledges that agencies such as the CIA could teach agents how to counter the full-body motion method by freezing their bodies but he said that in itself would be a giveaway."}
