In determining the patient's unique needs, it is becoming increasingly important for the\ndentist to work with other cutting-edge, integrative practitioners to fully assess the individual\nrequirements of the patient before, during, and after dental care. Witnessing the beginning of truly\ngroundbreaking advances in technology is a rare opportunity. Skepticism is a natural reaction when we\nare presented with a radically new method and its potential uses. Skepticism helps us filter the valuable\nfrom the worthless, the permanent from the ephemeral, and the rational from the preposterous. The\npresent article describes a brief review on some of the breakthrough advances in dentistry regarding\ntissue engineering, nanodentistry and ozone therapy.\nKey words: Nanodentistry, ozone therapy, tissue engineering.\nINTRODUCTION\nPatients today are increasingly taking more responsibility\nfor their own health care. They tend to be well-read,\neducated by previous health-care experiences, and much\nmore discriminating in their own choice of practitioners\nand treatment methods. As health practitioners struggling\nwith the complex task of helping these patients achieve\noptimum wellness, we should constantly search for the\ninformation that best answers their questions and offers\nsolutions to their health concerns (Kumar et al., 2010).\nNanodentistry will make possible the maintenance of\ncomprehensive oral health by employing nanomaterials,\nbiotechnology including tissue engineering, and\nultimately, dental nanorobotics (nanomedicine). When the\nfirst micron-size dental nanorobots can be constructed in\n10 to 20 years, these devices will allow precisely\ncontrolled oral analgesia, dentition replacement therapy\nusing biologically autologous whole replacement teeth\nmanufactured during a single office visit, and rapid\nnanometer-scale precision restorative dentistry. New\ntreatment opportunities may include dentition\nrenaturalization, permanent hypersensitivity cure,\ncomplete orthodontic realignments during a single office\nvisit, covalently-bonded diamondized enamel, and\ncontinuous oral health maintenance using mechanical\ndentifrobots (Sharma et al., 2010).\nMost of people possess a fear towards dentistry. On\naccount of this fear, they avoid the dental treatment.\nInfact, people fear injections and drills that are used in\ndental clinics. Although, in recent time, dentistry has been\nexperiencing a period of dynamic changes and growth,\nperhaps like no other time before. The use of ozone in\ndental treatment is the result of this dynamics and\ngrowth. Incorporation of ozone in dental clinic set-ups\nwould eradicate the feeling of pain during dental\ntreatment and also cut off the treatment time,\nsignificantly. Ozone has been shown to stimulate\nremineralization of recent caries-affected teeth after a\nperiod of about six to eight weeks. Scientific support, as\nsuggested by demonstrated studies, for ozone therapy\npresents a potential for an atraumatic, biologically-based\ntreatment for conditions encountered in dental practice\n(Garg and Tandon, 2009).\nA new direction in the field of vital pulp therapy is given\nby the introduction of tissue engineering as an emerging\nscience. It aims to regenerate a functional tooth-tissue\nstructure by the interplay of three basic key elements:\nstem cells, morphogens and scaffolds. It is a\nmultidisciplinary approach that combines the principles of\nbiology, medicine, and engineering to repair and/or\nregenerate a damaged tissue and/or organ (Malhotra et \n2 J. Dev. Biol. Tissue Eng.\nal., 2009).\nThe present review article describes the future of\ndentistry and possible different treatment modalities in\nthe future including nanodentistry, ozone therapy and\ntissue engineering. We hope this mini review article be\nuseful for all dentists and our colleagues and open a new\nera in field of dentistry."}
