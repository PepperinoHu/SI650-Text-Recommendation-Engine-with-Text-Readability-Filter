{"id": "A2-521", "contents": "I was wondering if I could change my major from biology to political science.\nThose majors are very different from each other.\nI know, but I hate biology. I can't see myself studying it anymore.\nYou can change it, but you'll have to take more classes.\nI don't mind. Political science is really interesting to me.\nYou would be graduating a year late.\nOh, no. I have to think a little more about this then.\nI think you should change it, since you hate biology.\nYeah, you're right. I'm sorry I am so indecisive.\nA lot of people change majors. It's normal.\nBut not as late as I did. I hate that I'm graduating after all my friends.\nYou're making the right choice."}
