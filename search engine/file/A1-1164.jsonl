Could I have a quiet room with a view if possible, please?\nI will arrive at about 10 p.m. and I have an early meeting the next morning, so please could you leave an iron and ironing board in the room?\nI have a promotional code (MH2219). Please can you confirm that it is \u00a380 per night with breakfast included?\nPlease could you confirm the booking? Let me know if you need any further information.\nMany thanks.\nWith kind regards,\nDavid Mathews"}
