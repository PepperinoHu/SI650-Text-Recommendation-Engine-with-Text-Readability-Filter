{"id": "C2-1441", "contents": "Unfortunately, neither Nietzsche\u2019s ideas about the nature of value creation nor his suggestions about what specific values should be \u201ccreated\u201d have seemed as clear to readers as his negative critique of traditional values. (The disparity is often marked in the literature by doubts about whether Nietzsche has a \u201cpositive\u201d ethics to offer.) There is something to this reaction: Nietzsche\u2019s critique has a clear target and is developed at an extended scale, whereas his suggestions about alternative values can seem scattered or telegraphic. That said, it is not as though Nietzsche is the least bit shy about making evaluatively loaded claims, including \u201cpositive\u201d ones. To some extent, disappointment among commentators in search of \u201cpositive views\u201d arises from our looking for the wrong things\u2014for example, seeking a systematically organized axiological theory when Nietzsche himself is skeptical of any such project, or expecting any \u201cpositive\u201d ethics to accommodate certain \u201cmoral intuitions\u201d which Nietzsche is more inclined to challenge than to save. This section surveys some territory Nietzsche covers under the heading \u201cvalue creation\u201d. After mentioning different options for understanding the nature of such \u201ccreation\u201d, it explores some of the values he promotes."}
