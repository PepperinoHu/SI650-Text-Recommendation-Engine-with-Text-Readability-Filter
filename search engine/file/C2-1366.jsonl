Prices for staples such as corn and wheat have risen nearly 50% on international markets since June, triggered by severe droughts in the US and Russia, and weak monsoon rains in Asia. More than 18 million people are already facing serious food shortages across the Sahel. \nOxfam has forecast that the price spike will have a devastating impact in developing countries that rely heavily on food imports, including parts of Latin America, North Africa and the Middle East. Food shortages in 2008 led to civil unrest in 28 countries. \nAdopting a vegetarian diet is one option to increase the amount of water available to grow more food in an increasingly climate-erratic world, the scientists said. Animal protein-rich food consumes five to ten times more water than a vegetarian diet. One third of the world\u2019s arable land is used to grow crops to feed animals. Other options to feed people include eliminating waste and increasing trade between countries in food surplus and those in deficit. \n\u201cNine hundred million people already go hungry and two billion people are malnourished in spite of the fact that per-capita food production continues to increase,\u201d they said. \u201cWith 70% of all available water being in agriculture, growing more food to feed an additional two billion people by 2050 will place greater pressure on available water and land.\u201d \nThe report is being released at the start of the annual world water conference in Stockholm, Sweden, where 2,500 politicians, UN bodies, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries meet to address global water supply problems. \nCompetition for water between food production and other uses will intensify pressure on essential resources, the scientists said. \u201cThe UN predicts that we must increase food production by 70% by mid-century. This will place additional pressure on our already stressed water resources, at a time when we also need to allocate more water to satisfy global energy demand \u2013 which is expected to rise by 60% over the coming 30 years \u2013 and to generate electricity for the 1.3 billion people currently without it,\u201d said the report. \nOvereating, undernourishment and waste are all on the rise and increased food production may face future constraints from water scarcity. \n\u201cWe will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future,\u201d said the report\u2019s editor, Anders J\u00e4gerskog. \nA separate report from the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) said the best way for countries to protect millions of farmers from food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia was to help them invest in small pumps and simple technology, rather than to develop expensive, large-scale irrigation projects. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve witnessed again and again what happens to the world\u2019s poor \u2013 the majority of whom depend on agriculture for their livelihoods and already suffer from water scarcity \u2013 when they are at the mercy of our fragile global food system,\u201d said Dr Colin Chartres, the Director General. \n\u201cFarmers across the developing world are increasingly relying on and benefiting from small-scale, locally-relevant water solutions. [These] techniques could increase yields up to 300% and add tens of billions of US dollars to household revenues across sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.\u201d"}
