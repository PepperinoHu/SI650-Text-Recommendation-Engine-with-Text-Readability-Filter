{"id": "C1-664", "contents": "Freelancing, by definition, involves offering your skills\nto a variety of clients. You are claiming some specialist\nexpertise, be it in management consultancy, journalism,\ngraphic design or vehicle repair. But whatever it is, in\norder to make that claim, you must either have done the\njob before, or be trained in it in some convincingly\napplied way.\nIt is possible to become a freelance\ndesigner, for instance, on the basis of\nhaving done a degree course because\nsuch courses are generally practically\noriented. Or you could become a\ntranslator having taken a language\ndegree.\nYour credentials would be less impressive if you tried to\nset up as a management consultant, having had no\nexperience other than a business studies qualification, or\nif you tried to become a journalist on the basis of an\nEnglish degree. The first thing you will have to do as a\nfreelancer, therefore, is to see that your level of expertise\nis appropriate to the area where you want to apply it as a\nfreelancer.\nIn many cases, freelancers are ex-employees and they\ngenerally begin by working for their ex-employers. A\ncommon situation, for instance, is that a company closes\ndown a functional area like in-house PR or building\nmaintenance and asks the people who were doing it\nbefore to take it on as freelancers.\nThis means that the freelancers can\noffer the same service to a variety of\nclients without incurring the overheads\nthat become attached to corporate\nactivities. Quite often, a function that\nis uneconomic for a firm to sustain,\neither for that reason or because it is\nnot fully used, becomes very\nprofitable to freelancers.\nAs a freelancer, each approach to a new client is rather\nlike applying for another job and, as with a job\napplication, establishing your credibility by showing that\nyou can do what the job entails is an essential first step.\nOne way to do that is to demonstrate that you are already\nbusy, and a list of existing clients \u2013 particularly if they\nare well-known ones \u2013 validates that claim. Some\nfreelancers do this informally.\nFor instance, a cameraman said\nrecently, \u2018I never admit I haven\u2019t got\nmuch on. The way I put it is that I\u2019ve\ngot a spare week or so between\nassignments and I mention a couple of\nthings coming up, even if they\u2019re not\ndefinite at that time. But if I went in\nand said \u201cI\u2019m a bit short of work at the\nmoment \u2013 anything doing?\u201d they\u2019d\nassume I was going off a bit and\nwouldn\u2019t offer me anything.\u2019\nIn other branches of freelancing, formal evidence of\nwork done needs to be produced. Some kind of brochure\nwith the names of your clients and what you did for\nthem is a good investment as soon as you have worked\nfor a sufficient number of companies.\nWorking as a freelancer is in many ways different from\nworking as an employee. Consider, for example, this\nfundamental difference between the two situations. If\nyou are permanently based in the next office or at least\nin the same building as the person or department to\nwhom you are reporting, it is easy to check back and\nclarify aspects of the job as you go along. As a\nfreelancer though, you are on your own and in many\ncases the client is paying you to get on with the job\nwithout bothering him or her.\nSo if you have been commissioned as\na freelance copywriter, for instance,\nthe person who commissioned you\ndoes not want to have to deal with\nlast-minute queries about whether he\nor she wants a reply coupon to go with\nthe ad. These are the sort of questions\nthat should have been raised at the\nbriefing session.\nThat\u2019s the kind of mistake that comes from\ninexperience. If you have done similar work for an\norganisation before, you probably know what is\nexpected. But in the case of a first-time assignment it\u2019s\nall uncharted territory. Picking up how to go about\ndoing such work has to be learned and the best way of\ndoing so is with people who already know you and vice\nversa.\nIn these circumstances, you will at\nleast be tolerant of each other\u2019s\nmistakes and not ask for the\ntemperamentally or functionally\nimpossible. For instance, if the person\nyou are reporting to is careless about\nchecking subordinates\u2019 work, that\nplaces an extra burden on you to be\ncorrespondingly careful.\nHow ready your existing contacts are to put freelance\nassignments your way is an invaluable clue as to how\nmarketable your skills are. To some extent you should\nknow from your own experience what the demand is for\nfreelancers in your chosen sphere.\nFor instance, if you are a technical\nillustrator, you ought to be aware of\nwhether there are enough technical\npublishers who employ outsiders\nrather than in-house staff and, if so,\nwhat the rates of pay are. If the\ndemand is strong or rising, how\nsuccessful you are likely to be depends\non your own skill and speed.\nThe question of your own ability is one that has to be\nfaced in considering your chances. Freelancing is not an\neasy option for those who cannot hold down a job on\ngrounds of competence. You have to be good at what\nyou do to freelance successfully because the client will\nturn to someone else if you are not."}
