Now, for the first time, scientists have started to catalogue and map the bacteria coursing through a city\u2019s subway \u2013 and they have found a wealth of curious results. \nDr Christopher Mason, a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medical College, led a team that, for 18 months, swabbed the New York City subway system for the microscopic life forms that cover its turnstiles, seats, ticket booths and stations. In what Mason called \u201cthe first city-scale genetic profile ever\u201d, his team found meningitis at Times Square, a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan. \nIn research published in the journal Cell Systems, the team strongly downplayed the findings of plague and anthrax, noting the extremely small trace of the latter, that rats likely carried the former and that no one has fallen ill with plague in or around New York for years. \n\u201cThe results do not suggest that plague or anthrax is prevalent,\u201d the study says. \u201cNor do they suggest that New York residents are at risk.\u201d \nIn fact, most of the bacteria identified by the team are either harmless to humans or beneficial in the city\u2019s thriving world of microorganisms, many of which process toxic hazards and waste in the same way that bacteria inside every human help with digestion and bodily functions. \nSome of the results were expected, Mason said, including some bacteria associated with fecal matter, which he said \u201cshould be a gentle reminder for people to wash their hands\u201d. He also said that many bacteria of the same genus as those \u201cthat are beneficial and helpful, like the one used for making cheese,\u201d also turned up around New York. \nBacteria appeared to reflect the eating habits of various neighbourhoods. All around the subway, bacteria associated with cheeses \u2013 brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella of ubiquitous New York pizza \u2013 turned up. The distinctive bacteria of Swiss cheese were more localized to midtown Manhattan and the financial district, and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the financial district and Bay Ridge. The computer also identified cucumber DNA all over the city, Mason said. \nBacteria associated with illness and infections were extremely common. Species that cause diarrhoea and nausea, both benign and bad E.coli (mostly benign), and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city. The species that produces tetanus appeared in Soho and bacteria that cause dysentery appeared at a station in the Bronx and another in Harlem. \nWith more than 1,000 samples collected at all of New York\u2019s 466 open subway stations, Mason and his team ran the organic materials through a DNA sequencer and, then, through a supercomputer armed with genetic databases. They identified 15,152 distinct species, nearly half of which were bacteria. \nThe good news, the researchers wrote, is that these \u201cpotentially infectious agents\u201d are not spreading sickness or disease throughout New York but rather seem to be \u201cnormal co-habitants\u201d and \u201cmay even be essential\u201d. They \u201crepresent a normal, 'healthy' metagenome profile of a city\u201d. \nIn short, the researchers conclude, the subway and city are about as safe as everyone thought. \nMason said people should not be concerned about getting urinary-tract infections from subway seats. \u201cYou should wash your hands,\u201d he said, \u201cand probably get some sleep and eat salads and go to the gym, and that\u2019s about the same today as it was yesterday.\u201d \n\u201cIf anything,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019ve become much more confident riding the subway.\u201d \nMany findings made sense: heavily trafficked stations like Grand Central and Times Square had more bacteria and more diversity among them; the subway was most enriched for bacteria associated with skin. The Bronx, with its diverse neighbourhoods and stations, had the greatest diversity of bacteria; Staten Island, with just three stops, had the lowest. \nThe researchers found marine bacteria at South Ferry, a station that flooded during Hurricane Sandy \u2013 but they were surprised to note the species included some normally associated with Antarctica and fish. \nThe next steps, Mason said, are studies of other cities, which have begun in Paris, S\u00e3o Paolo and Shanghai, and continued studies of New York, for instance to see how the microbiome changes with the seasons. He said he hoped the research would provide \u201ca baseline\u201d of research for health officials and geneticists, and could help health officials to be better prepared to prevent and track diseases and pathogens."}
