She is number 34. \nWhen it\u2019s her turn, Maria is called forward to pick up a brown paper bag filled with essentials including pasta, eggs and cornflakes, and is invited to choose between butternut squash or carrots as this week\u2019s vegetables. \nMaria is the 34th \u201cclient\u201d so far today at East Hampton Food Pantry, a community initiative set up just streets away from some of the most expensive and exclusive properties in the world. By the end of the day, the food pantry\u2019s organizers expect more than 400 families to have followed Maria through the doors to collect their weekly food parcel to help them get through the cold, dark Long Island winter. \nIn the summertime, the Hamptons, a collection of historic oceanfront towns and villages 100 miles from Manhattan, is a billionaires\u2019 playground. But, come Labor Day in early September, when the rich and famous shut up their mansions and head back to Manhattan or Beverly Hills, the glitz gives way to the gritty reality of life for the mostly immigrant community who live here all year. \u201cThe people who come here are rich and famous but we who live here are not,\u201d says Maria, who works 14-hour days in the summer cleaning mansions but goes months without any work at all in the winter. \nMaria laughs when asked if she has enough money. \u201cThere is no work in the winter, only in the summertime,\u201d says Maria, who, like many of the workers in the Hamptons, is from Latin America. \u201cHere, lots of people live in a single room because they can\u2019t pay the rent.\u201d \nShe says some families with up to five children are crammed into basements and still pay more than $1,000 a month in rent. \u201cPeople come here looking for work but, in the winter, there is nothing.\u201d \nLots of her friends can\u2019t pay for heating or medication and many would go hungry if it were not for the East Hampton Food Pantry, she says, which is just one of several food pantries in the town. \nVicki Littman, chairperson of the East Hampton Food Pantry, which provided more than 31,000 food parcels in 2015, says the number of people seeking out the food pantry is ever increasing. \u201cOnce Labor Day comes and the season is over and people\u2019s hours start to be cut back, our numbers go up to about 400 families a week,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen they come to us on Tuesday, they get two to three days\u2019 worth of food. Without us, they would struggle that much more.\u201d Littman says it can be hard for outsiders to realize that there are people struggling to get by in a place known the world over for its excess. \n\u201cWhen I discuss with the summer community that comes out here about the food pantries, they\u2019re always shocked because there is that glamorous side of the Hamptons where there are galas and the beaches and the mansions that are here. \u201cBut, what people don\u2019t realize is that there is that service industry. It\u2019s the landscapers, the nannies, the waitresses \u2013 they are all relying on that summer income to get them through the winter but people don\u2019t see that when they\u2019re coming out on holiday. \n\u201cThere are seniors who have to sometimes pick between whether they are going to pay for their medications or pay their bills or buy food, and that shouldn\u2019t be the case.\u201d \nLittman says the town has lost too many people working key jobs \u2013 such as teachers, police officers and even doctors and dentists \u2013 because they can\u2019t afford to live in the community and the food pantry board is determined to do more to ensure people have a better shot at staying put. Housing is, by far, the biggest cost in the Hamptons. At $147m, the nation\u2019s most expensive property is hedge fund manager Barry Rosenstein\u2019s 18-acre beachfront estate at 67 Further Lane, a stone\u2019s throw from Maidstone Golf Club, which is considered \u201cthe most elite, prestigious and difficult to get into\u201d of all the Hamptons clubs. \nLarry Cantwell, East Hampton\u2019s town supervisor and lifelong resident, says homes regularly change hands at more than $25m and the rapid price inflation at the top end has trickled down to even the town\u2019s most modest flats. \n\u201cFinding your first home is a challenge in an area like this,\u201d Cantwell says. \u201cNot just people who you would characterize as poor \u2013 working- and middle-class families are also having a hard time. If you can find a home to buy anywhere in East Hampton for $500,000, you\u2019re very lucky.\u201d Cantwell says more than half the town\u2019s homes are empty for most of the year, which causes the population to dwindle to as little as 10,000 in the winter months compared with 80,000 in August. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the tale of two cities. There\u2019s certainly a lot of wealth here but almost all of that wealth is in second homes only used in the summer,\u201d says Cantwell, the son of a fisherman father and a house-cleaner mother. \u201cBut, the rest of us live here year round. \n\u201cThere are famous and very wealthy people but then you have hard-working and poor people struggling to get by. You\u2019ve got to remember that this community was founded as a farming and fishing community of people who lived off the land and the water \u2013 a real working-class community.\u201d \nCantwell says saving up enough money to buy your first house while working as a farmer or fisherman is near-impossible in East Hampton today \u201cand it\u2019s not just the poor \u2013 police officers, teachers, young professionals and others all struggle to find a place to live here and many of them cannot afford to own their own home.\u201d \nBeing homeless in the Hamptons means spending a lot of time on a bus. Various houses of worship have joined together to ensure there is somewhere for the homeless to spend the night over the winter. Churches up and down the north and south fork of Long Island take on the burden one night at a time and roughly 50 homeless people are bussed between them every day. Eddie Vallone, 22, is one of those on the bus every night. \u201cPeople look at the Hamptons as some sort of rich town and there\u2019s no problems going on. But there are a lot of problems here, especially drugs. \n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to really grasp \u2013'OK, the summer is coming to an end. What am I going to do for the winter?'\u201d Vallone says at Maureen\u2019s Haven, a charity that coordinates the homeless shelter programme. \u201cI want to work but there\u2019s no work to be done.\u201d \nVallone, who works cleaning pools and doing odd jobs on luxury estates, says that, if he saves well and doesn\u2019t impulse-buy, he can make his summer earnings stretch out until November. \u201cBut, work doesn\u2019t start again until May or the beginning of June.\u201d"}
