{"id": "A2-542", "contents": "Arsenal striker Eduardo has been ruled out for two weeks with a hamstring injury just days after returning from a broken leg.\nEduardo sinks to his knees after opening the scoring on his Arsenal first team comeback on Monday.\nThe Croatian international only made his comeback after a year out in Monday's FA Cup fourth-round victory against Cardiff.\nThe 25-year-old marked his return with two goals in the 4-0 success at the Emirates Stadium, but his latest setback is not described as serious.\nManager Arsene Wenger told Arsenal TV Online: Eduardo is out for two weeks. He picked up a hamstring injury two minutes before I took him off. What a nightmare.\n Nobody knows how it happened but I knew straight away after the game it would be a two-week job. It is nothing like he had before but I do know that little setbacks like this are part of being nine months out.\n After that long out nobody plays six months on the trot. It is impossible. But at the same time it is a blow because, of course, he can score goals. He had shown that on Monday night."}
