{"id": "C2-1387", "contents": "A classic formulation of a criteriological argument for miracles is employed by Charles Leslie (1697/1815: 13), who argues that we may safely believe an historical claim that meets four criteria:\nThat the matters of fact be such, as that men\u2019s outward senses, their eyes and ears, may be judges of it.\nThat it be done publicly in the face of the world.\nThat not only public monuments be kept up in memory of it, but some outward actions to be performed.\nThat such monuments, and such actions or observances, be instituted, and do commence from the time that the matter of fact was done.\nThe first two criteria, Leslie explains, \u201cmake it impossible for any such matter of fact to be imposed upon men, at the time when such fact was said to be done, because every man\u2019s eyes and senses would contradict it.\u201d The latter two criteria assure those who come afterwards that the account of the event was not invented subsequent to the time of the purported event. Leslie points out that these criteria are not necessary conditions of factual truth, but he insists that they are\u2014taken jointly\u2014sufficient. Hence we may speak of Leslie\u2019s principle: If any reported event meets all four of these criteria, then its historicity is certain.\nIn assessing a criteriological argument, we need to ask not only whether the event in question meets the criteria but also whether the criteria themselves are good indicators of truth. An argument for the criteria that Leslie gives cannot proceed wholly a priori, since there is not a necessary connection between an event\u2019s satisfying the criteria and its being true. In this case, perhaps the most promising approach would be to argue that the criteria effectively rule out explanations other than the truth of the claim. Leslie\u2019s remarks suggest that this is the direction he would go if challenged, but he does not offer a fully developed defense of his criteria.\nLeslie\u2019s argument is, in the sense outlined above, categorical\u2014he holds that, as the claim of the resurrection meets all four criteria (the memorials being supplied by the Christian commemoration of the last supper and the transfer of the day of worship from the Sabbath (Saturday) to the first day of the week (Sunday)), the certainty of the matter of fact in question is \u201cdemonstrated.\u201d This rather bold claim opens the possibility of refutation of Leslie\u2019s principle by counterexample, though reportedly Conyers Middleton, a contemporary of Hume whose critique of the ecclesiastical miracles was notable for its thoroughness, searched vainly for years for a counterexample to Leslie\u2019s principle. Be that as it may, a criteriological argument may also be constructed on the basis of a more modest principle, such as that if any reported event meets all four of these criteria, then it is reasonable to accept its historicity.\nThe chief difficulty with criteriological arguments, whether bold or modest, is that they provide no means for taking into account any other considerations that might weigh against the historical claim in question. Intuitively, extreme antecedent improbability ought to carry some weight in our evaluation of the credibility of a factual claim. A defender of a criteriological argument might respond that so long as the bar is set high enough, antecedent improbability will be overwhelmed by the fact that the event does indeed meet the stipulated criteria. But this is a claim that requires argument; and the bolder the conclusion, the more argument it requires."}
