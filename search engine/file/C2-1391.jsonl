{"id": "C2-1391", "contents": "All we know about the so-called founder of the so-called Dialectical school, Clinomachus of Thurii, is that he was the first who wrote about predicates (kat\u00eagor\u00eamata) and propositions (axi\u00f4mata) and the like (DL 2.112). Our evidence for Diodorus and Philo confirms that they, too, conceived of logic as a logic of propositions. It was the Stoics who systematically developed a logic of propositions and devised subtle classifications of predicates. (By contrast, Aristotle's logic had been a logic of terms, where subject and predicate terms were in principle interchangeable.) The logic of the Dialectical school thus was a precursor of Stoic logic.\nAt the time of Diodorus and Philo a distinction between simple and non-simple propositions was in circulation among the minor Greek Socratic philosophical sects (DL 2.139). Simple propositions were divided into affirmations and negations (ibid.). Among non-simple propositions, which were thought to be composed of simple ones, conditionals, disjunctions and conjunctions were distinguished. Disjunctions or conditionals featured as premises in many of the logical paradoxes and sophisms which members of the Dialectical school discussed. It is likely that Diodorus and Philo examined the truth-conditions of all three kinds of non-simple propositions; however, we know their views only for the case of the conditional (see below sect. 3).\nTheir treatment of conditionals and modalities implies that \u2014 like most Hellenistic philosophers \u2014 Diodorus and Philo worked with a concept of proposition that differs from ours in that it allows truth-values to change over time. For instance, the standard example for a simple proposition, \u2018It is day\u2019, does not contain a covert fixed date or definite time determination; rather, it ranges over times, changing its truth-value twice daily, all the while remaining the same proposition. Thus we may think of propositions as they were understood by Hellenistic philosophers as functions of time. Diodorus Cronus can perhaps also be credited with the beginnings of temporal logic, as both his theory of the conditional and his accounts of the modalities are built on logically relevant temporal properties of propositions (see below sects. 3.2 and 4.2). Moreover, he distinguished between propositions in the present tense like \u2018Helen has three husbands\u2019 and \u2018These men are marrying\u2019 and propositions in a tense of completion (the aorist), \u2018Helen had three husbands\u2019 and \u2018These men married\u2019, and observed that it is possible for propositions like the latter two to be true, without there ever having been a time at which a corresponding one of the former type was true (Sextus Empiricus [SE], Against the Physicists 2.97-8).\nApart from the various logical puzzles and sophisms, there are only two topics on which we can be sure of a positive contribution to logic by members of the Dialectical school. These are the positions of Diodorus and Philo on the theory of conditionals and on modal logic. Both topics involve notorious difficulties and were extensively and intensely discussed by Hellenistic logicians; so much so that the disputes became part of the general knowledge of the intelligentsia of the time (SE, Against the Grammarians 309-10). Moreover, the theory of modalities was believed to have far-reaching results for other areas of philosophy."}
