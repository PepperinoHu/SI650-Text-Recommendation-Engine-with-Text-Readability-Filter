The veteran of past missions said that his biggest surprise was simply how long this one felt. \u201cMaybe, occasionally, you do go bananas,\u201d he said. \nKelly and a Russian counterpart, Mikhail Kornienko, spent nearly a year on the International Space Station (ISS) in order to study the effects of weightlessness, radiation and the cramped quarters of spaceflight on humans \u2013 research NASA considers essential for an eventual mission to Mars. \nKelly said the length of the mission was its biggest challenge and that he felt significantly more sore on returning to gravity than after shorter trips. Kelly and his twin brother, Mark, a retired astronaut, have spent the last year taking physical and mental tests. The tests will continue, to help NASA learn about how the body copes with the severe strains of spaceflight. \nKelly said he felt aches and had extremely sensitive skin but, so far, his balance has felt mostly decent. However, he said, \u201cthe first thing I tried to throw on a table I missed\u201d because \u201cyou tend to underestimate the effects of gravity\u201d. \nHe said the discomfort of returning to gravity \u2013 which shrank him back down to normal height after he stretched by 1.5 inches in orbit \u2013 took nothing away from the awe he felt after his capsule landed back on Earth. When the Russian capsule opened on to the cool air of Kazakhstan, Kelly said, he smelled \u201ca fragrance like a plant was blooming in that area\u201d. It was the fresh air mingled with the charred, \u201ckind of sweet\u201d smell of a spacecraft that had survived re-entry through the atmosphere. \nBacking away from the vessel, he said, the scope of the mission began to sink in: 340 days on a 15-year-old space station which is \u201ca million pounds, the size of a football field, the internal volume, some say, of a six-bedroom house \u201d. The ISS, he said, is a place that uses the power of the sun and was built with the help of an international team and millions of taxpayers. \n\u201cThere are things we\u2019re going to discover about our experience in space in the space station that we don\u2019t even know now,\u201d Kelly said, comparing the research of more than 450 missions there to the work done by computer scientists at NASA in the 1960s and 1970s. He added: \u201cThe view is great, too.\u201d \nKelly made the most of that view, posting spectacular photos on social media of the Earth\u2019s cities, landscapes, oceans and atmosphere. \u201cThe Earth is a beautiful planet,\u201d he said, describing the striking colours of the waters around the Bahamas and the rainbow hues of lakes that dot the northern Himalayas. He said he would like to visit that region, though he would first need to learn \u201cwhat country actually owns them\u201d. But, \u201cpredominantly, you just notice how thin the atmosphere is, how fragile it looks,\u201d Kelly added. \u201cThat, combined with these large swathes of pollution, is kind of alarming.\u201d \nThe astronaut said he could see entire systems of pollution: smoke clouds from wildfires that covered parts of the US, sections of Asia with continuous, visible pollution nearly all year round. He said the message \u201cwe need to save the planet\u201d slightly missed the point: \u201cThe planet will get better; it\u2019s us that won\u2019t be here because we\u2019ll destroy the environment.\u201d The world\u2019s thin shield of atmosphere \u201cmakes you more of an environmentalist after spending so much time looking down\u201d, he said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s for us to take care of the air we breathe and the water we drink. And I do believe we have an impact on that and we do have the ability to change it, if we make the decision to.\u201d Kelly\u2019s active social- media life, which he said was a joint effort with his girlfriend, earned him a huge online following. But he said he was unaware of it, instead he was watching the chaotic drama of the 2016 presidential election. One of the first questions he asked the crew who lifted him out of a space capsule was \u201cHow did Super Tuesday go?\u201d \nBut the astronaut demurred when asked for his thoughts on the likes of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. \u201cI would say that, as a government employee, I am subject to the Hatch Act,\u201d he said, referring to a law that prohibits some political activity for federal employees. \u201cSo I can\u2019t say how I think of all the news stories of all the year.\u201d \nBesides the news, he said, steady work helped keep him sane: \u201cI tried to have milestones that were close, like when is the next crew arriving, the next spacewalk, the next robotics, the next science experiment. That made a difference to me, keeping my sanity.\u201d Being back on Earth with the rest of humanity had not quite sunk in, he added, recalling how shocked he had been to see a crowd of people after a previous mission. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a point here pretty soon where I\u2019ll start feeling that kind of culture shock,\u201d he said. \nAlthough a NASA scientist said Kelly embodied the qualities needed for a mission to Mars, the astronaut himself predicted that he would not fly again with the space agency. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I would ever say I\u2019m absolutely, 100% done,\u201d he added, noting the sudden successes of private spaceflight companies such as SpaceX. \u201cThey might need a guy like me someday,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe, in the next 20 years, you\u2019ll be able to buy a cheap ticket, just go for a little visit.\u201d"}
