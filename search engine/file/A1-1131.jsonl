That's all I'm saying.\nOkay, well I'm going to leave now.\nWhy are you in a rush to leave?\nBecause you are being rude, and I don't want to speak to you.\nWell, now I know you can't take criticism.\nIt's not that I can't take criticism; it's that I don't like jerks.\nHow am I a jerk? I'm just giving you my honest opinion.\nWell, in my honest opinion, I don't care what you think.\nNow, that was rude. I don't want to talk to you anymore.\nGreat. Believe me; I won't be losing any sleep."}
