But, in Asia and Europe, stock markets overall displayed a muted reaction, with traders apparently expecting another battle in Washington early in 2014. \nThe shutdown is estimated to have cost the US $24bn, according to the ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s. China\u2019s official Xinhua News Agency had accused Washington of jeopardizing other countries\u2019 dollar assets. China is the US government\u2019s largest creditor. \nObama signed the necessary legislation to fend off a default shortly after midnight on Thursday after a Republican split in the House of Representatives. The bill had passed easily with broad bipartisan support in the Senate, where Democratic and Republican leaders forged the agreement. It offers a temporary fix, funding the government until 15 January and raising the debt ceiling until 7 February. \nBut the president made clear he did not expect another bitter budget fight and shutdown in 2014. \nIn brief remarks at the White House shortly before the House vote, Obama said he hoped the deal would \u201clift the cloud of uncertainty\u201d that had hung over the country in recent weeks. \n\u201cOnce this agreement arrives on my desk, I will sign it immediately,\u201d he said, in a statement delivered at the White House. \u201cHopefully, next time it won\u2019t be in the eleventh hour. We\u2019ve got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis.\u201d \nAs he left the lectern after his Wednesday night press briefing, the president was asked by a journalist whether the crisis would happen all over again in a few months. Speaking over his shoulder, Obama replied, \u201cNo.\u201d \nEarlier, the Republican senator Mike Lee had struck a defiant tone, perhaps indicating more trouble ahead: \u201cThe media keeps asking: 'Was it worth it?' My answer is, it is always worth it to do the right thing.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is not over.\u201d \nHowever, the political deal was one of the worst of all possible outcomes for Republicans. None of their stated goals was achieved and polls showed that voters overwhelmingly blamed them for the crisis."}
