{"id": "B2-276", "contents": "\ufeffThe continual relegation of women to the sidelines of football was given a good kicking when France appointed its first female professional team manager. It did not matter that it was a second-division club. It did not matter if it was, as some bad sports \u2013 male, of course \u2013 suggested, just a cynical stunt to drum up publicity for a minor team, Clermont Foot 63, currently ranking a lowly 14th out of 20 in its league. \nWhat mattered was that Helena Costa had been given the top job, a move that saw her make football history by becoming the first female manager to be appointed in the highest two divisions of any professional European league. \u201cAs a woman, it\u2019s made me happy,\u201d V\u00e9ronique Soulier, president of the club\u2019s supporters\u2019 association, told journalists. \u201cWhen I first heard the news, I was rather surprised, but, once that passed, we were pretty unanimous that it\u2019s good news. We all agree that a woman at the head of a group of men is no bad thing.\u201d \nThe new manager of Clermont Foot 63, whose average home crowd at the stadium at Clermont- Ferrand in the Auvergne region of south-central France is around 3,800, is a former talent spotter for the Scottish Premiership side Celtic. Costa, 36, was born in Alhandra on the River Tagus in southeast Portugal and graduated with a master\u2019s degree in sports science. She is also a UEFA-licensed coach. She previously coached Benfica\u2019s male youth teams, the Qatar women\u2019s team, which she led to its first international victory in 2012, and, more recently, the Iranian women\u2019s national side, which she left in September 2013. \nCosta was appointed on a two-year contract by the president of Clermont Foot 63, Claude Michy, who is a champion at grabbing the headlines for his club. In 2013, he announced the team had signed Messi. They had. Not the Argentinian and FC Barcelona record-breaking striker Lionel Messi, but Junior Messi Enguene, a 20-year-old midfielder from Cameroon. \nFrance\u2019s women\u2019s minister, Najat Vallaud- Belkacem, tweeted: \u201cBravo to Clermont Foot for understanding that giving women a place is the future of professional football.\u201d \nCarolina Morace, an Italian who was the only previous woman coach of a men\u2019s professional team, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know Helena, but, if she has been hired by a team, then it means that she knows how to do her job. I hope that, one day, this can become normal.\u201d Morace was an outstanding player in the women\u2019s game. She was the top scorer for 12 seasons in Italy\u2019s Serie A and played for Italy in 153 internationals. In 1999, she was named as the coach of Viterbese in the men\u2019s Serie C1. But, after only two games, she resigned from the job following a clash with the club\u2019s mercurial proprietor, Luciano Gaucci, who at the time was also the owner of a Serie A side, Perugia. \nMorace was quoted as saying that she had refused Gaucci\u2019s demand that she fire her deputy and the side\u2019s trainer. \u201cHe let me know that I could carry on working with whomever I wanted. But, by then, mutual trust was lacking and I didn\u2019t fancy carrying on in that climate of uncertainty,\u201d she said. Morace works today as a lawyer in Rome and as expert soccer commentator on television and in the pages of the daily Gazzetta dello Sport. \nShe said: \u201cFor the time being, I see too many men, even in the women\u2019s game, who are working, despite not having the same expertise as women, who, by contrast, are not working.\u201d Raymond Domenech, former manager of the French national team, said: \u201cWomen know how to play football and how to manage and are good at doing it. Why shouldn\u2019t they manage men\u2019s teams? The opposite happens and doesn\u2019t cause any problems. It\u2019s a natural choice and reflects our society in which women are equal to men. I say well done to President Michy. I told myself that, if I took charge of a club again, I\u2019d hire a woman as my number two. He beat me to it.\u201d \nA statement on Clermont Foot 63\u2019s website said Costa\u2019s appointment would allow the club to enter \u201ca new era\u201d. On the club supporters\u2019 website, reaction to Costa\u2019s appointment was a mix of surprise and a certain cynicism. \u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s just a publicity stunt to get people talking about the club and she won\u2019t last the season. I find it hard to believe she\u2019ll be able to get the players\u2019 respect, above all when she\u2019s the same age as the oldest,\u201d wrote one fan. \u201cHer CV isn\u2019t bad, but now the question is: will she be good enough?\u201d added another. A third wrote: \u201cI wish her welcome and success but I think it\u2019ll be hard for her to make her mark as a woman in such a macho business. Has our president pulled off a media coup?\u201d \nBut Soulier was hopeful: \u201cHopefully, with the new manager, the club can find the motivation they\u2019re lacking at the moment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe boys in the team can be difficult to manage. With a woman in charge, maybe they\u2019ll be less demanding.\u201d \nIf Costa\u2019s reputation is anything to go by, she will be the one making the demands. After doing work experience at Chelsea during her compatriot Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s first stint as manager of the club between 2004 and 2007, she was reportedly described as \u201cMourinho in a skirt\u201d. Costa quickly kicked the sexist remark into touch. \u201cLike Mourinho, I always want to win. As far as that\u2019s concerned, yes, I\u2019m happy to be compared with him,\u201d she said."}
