In a speech at the British Science Festival, Dr Paul Kelley, clinical research associate at the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford University, called for schools to stagger their starting times to work with the natural biological rhythms of their students. It would improve cognitive performance, exam results and students\u2019 health (sleep deprivation has been linked with diabetes, depression, obesity and an impaired immune system). \nIt follows a paper, published in 2014, in which he noted that, when children are around ten, their biological wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, someone you may think of as a lazy teenager actually has a natural waking hour of 9am. The conventional school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not 16- to 18-year-olds. For the older teenagers, it might be more sensible to start the school day at 11am or even later. \u201cA 7am alarm call for older adolescents,\u201d Kelley and his colleagues pointed out in the paper, \u201cis the equivalent of a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s.\u201d \nHe says it\u2019s not as simple as persuading teenagers to go to bed earlier. \u201cThe body\u2019s natural rhythm is controlled by a particular kind of light,\u201d says Kelley. \u201cThe eye doesn\u2019t just contain rods and cones; it contains cells that then report to the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus.\u201d This part of the brain controls our circadian rhythms over a 24-hour cycle. \u201cIt\u2019s the light that controls it. It\u2019s like saying: 'Why can\u2019t you control your heartbeat?'\u201d \nBut it isn\u2019t just students who would benefit from a later start. Kelley says the working day should be more forgiving of our natural rhythms. Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: \u201cBetween 14 and 24, it\u2019s more than two hours. For people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, it\u2019s about an hour and a half. That can continue up until you\u2019re about 55 when it\u2019s in balance again. The 10-year-old and 55-year-old wake and sleep naturally at the same time.\u201d \nThis might be why, he adds, the traditional nine to five is so ingrained; it is maintained by bosses, many of them in their mid-50s and upwards because \u201cit is best for them\u201d. So, should workplaces have staggered starting times, too? Should those in their 50s and above come in at 8am, while those in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage intern or apprentice be encouraged to turn up at 11am? Kelley says that synchronized hours could have \u201cmany positive consequences. The positive side of this is people\u2019s performance, mood and health will improve. It\u2019s very uplifting in a way because it\u2019s a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do.\u201d \nThere would probably be fewer accidents as drivers would be more alert, he says. It could spell the end of rush hour as people stagger their work and school-run times. A later start to the day for many, says Kelley, \u201cis something that would benefit everyone, particularly families. Parents go and try to wake up teenagers who are waking up three hours too early. It creates tensions for everybody.\u201d \nSo, what time does Kelley start work? \u201cI am 67 so that means I\u2019m back to being ten years old and I get up just after six. I wake naturally.\u201d And, yes, he says he finds the start of his working day much easier now than he did when he was younger."}
