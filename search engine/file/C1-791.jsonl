The report reveals the shocking extent of attacks on women from the men with whom they share their lives, with 30% of women being attacked by partners. It also finds that a large proportion of murders of women \u2013 38% \u2013 are carried out by intimate partners. \n\u201cThese findings send a powerful message that violence against women is a global health problem of epidemic proportions,\u201d said Dr Margaret Chan, director general of the WHO. \u201cWe also see that the world\u2019s health systems can and must do more for women who experience violence.\u201d \nThe highest levels of violence against women are in Africa, where nearly half of all women \u2013 45.6% \u2013 will suffer physical or sexual violence. In low- and middle-income Europe, the proportion is 27.2%. Yet, wealthier nations are not necessarily always safer for women \u2013 a third of women in high-income countries (32.7%) will experience violence at some stage in their lives. Of the women who suffer violence, 42% sustain injuries, which can bring them to the attention of healthcare staff. That, says the report, is often the first opportunity for violence in the home to be detected and for the woman to be offered help. Violence has a profound effect on women\u2019s health. Some arrive at hospital with broken bones, while others suffer pregnancy-related complications and mental illness. \nThe two reports from the WHO \u2013 one on the prevalence of violence, the other offering guidelines to healthcare staff on helping women \u2013 are the work of Dr Claudia Garcia-Moreno, lead specialist in gender, reproductive rights, sexual health and adolescence at WHO, and Professor Charlotte Watts, an epidemiologist who specializes in gender, violence and health, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \n\u201cFor the first time, we have compared data from all over the world on the magnitude of partner violence and sexual violence by non-partners and the impact of these sorts of violence on health,\u201d said Garcia-Moreno. These included HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, depression, women turning to alcohol, unwanted pregnancies and low-birthweight babies. \nThere were variations in the rates of violence against women in different regions of the world but, said Garcia-Moreno, \u201cin whatever region we looked at, it is unacceptably high\u201d. Even in high-income countries, 23.2% of women will suffer physical and/or sexual violence from a partner in their lives, their data from 81 countries shows. The global figure for women attacked by partners was 30%. \nMore sexual assaults and rapes by acquaintances or strangers are reported in high-income countries than elsewhere \u2013 the report says that 12.6% of women in wealthy countries will be sexually attacked by a non-partner in their lives, which is higher than the African rate of 11.9%. But, the data on such crimes is not well collected in all regions. \nThe authors say that their previous research shows that better-educated women are less likely to suffer violence, as are those who have jobs, although not in all regions. There is a need to tackle social norms, said Watts. \u201cWhat is society\u2019s attitude concerning the acceptability of certain forms of violence against women?\u201d she asked. \u201cIn some societies, it is not OK \u2013 but not all.\u201d \n\u201cI think the numbers are a wake-up call for all of us to pay more attention to this issue,\u201d said Garcia-Moreno. Over the past decade, there has been increasing recognition of the problem, she said, but \u201cone has to recognize that it is a complex problem. We don\u2019t have a vaccine or a pill \u201d. \nThe new WHO clinical and policy guidelines recommend training for healthcare staff in recognizing the signs of domestic violence and sexual assault, but they rule out general screening \u2013 there is not a case for asking every woman who arrives in a clinic whether she has been subjected to violence. \n\u201cBut, if you see a woman coming back several times with undisclosed injuries, you should be asking about domestic violence,\u201d said Garcia-Moreno. \u201cWhen I was training in medical school, it wasn\u2019t something you learned or knew about. Years later, I was sometimes in a situation where I could tell there was something else going on in the woman I was interviewing, but didn\u2019t have any sense that domestic violence was the issue. Now, I think I would handle the interview very differently.\u201d"}
