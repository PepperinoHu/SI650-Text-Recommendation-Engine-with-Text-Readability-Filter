New category- killers like Google, Amazon and Facebook have reset customer expectations and significantly raised the bar for brand experiences.\u201d \nApple, which former Chief Executive Steve Jobs founded in his Los Altos garage in 1976, only appeared in the top ten of the Interbrand annual study in 2011. \nIts logo, created by advertising executive Rob Janoff in 1977, was designed with a bite taken out of it to avoid confusion with a cherry. \u201cOne of the deep mysteries to me is our logo, the symbol of lust and knowledge, bitten into, all crossed with the colours of the rainbow in the wrong order. You couldn\u2019t dream of a more appropriate logo: lust, knowledge, hope and anarchy,\u201d Janoff said. \nGraham Hayles, Interbrand\u2019s chief marketing officer, said it was \u201cnot out of kilter\u201d that Apple\u2019s brand could account for a fifth of the company\u2019s entire market value. \u201cApple makes a lot of money because it has a very strong brand,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a very strong correlation between branding and profitability.\u201d \nHayles said Interbrand, which has been carrying out the annual study since 2000, calculates brand value by examining companies\u2019 financial performance, consumers\u2019 \u201cbrand allegiance\u201d and \u201cbrand-strength analysis \u201d. \nWhile many technology companies rose up the chart, there were big fallers, too. Finnish mobile- phone company Nokia dropped 41 places to 98th at $4.1bn, just ahead of Nintendo in 100th place (down 33). \u201cThey\u2019re both only just in the chart now,\u201d Hayles said. \u201cIt shows the importance of getting innovation right. If you don\u2019t keep pace, it is very penalizing.\u201d \nA Chinese company has made it into the top 100 for the first time, with mobile-phone and broadband firm Huawei entering the rankings in 94th place with a brand value of $4.3bn. Huawei has been partly banned by the US and Australian governments due to fears that its equipment could be used by the Chinese for cyber-espionage. \nMost of the brands in the top 100 are US-owned, the highest-placed non-US brands being South Korea\u2019s Samsung (6th), Japan\u2019s Toyota (8th) and Germany\u2019s Mercedes-Benz (10th). The highest- placed British brands are HSBC (33rd), Shell (65th) and Burberry (73rd). \nOther fashion brands in the top 100 include Boss, Prada and Ralph Lauren. Designer label Louis Vuitton is the top-ranked fashion name, in 19th position, with a value of $23bn, just ahead of high-street clothing chain H&M, with a brand value of $21bn and ranked 21. \nSports brand Nike, ranked 22 with a brand valued at nearly $20bn, is rated way ahead of rival Adidas, at 59 in the top 100 with a value of $7bn. \nFrampton said consumers\u2019 ability to interact with and criticize brands on Twitter and other social media means companies must react faster to retain and improve their brands\u2019 reputations. \n\u201cThe customer, empowered by social media in the 'age of experience', now has more control than ever,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this world of two-way conversations, advocacy, influence and engagement are the new rules for brand-building. \n\u201cCustomers expect seamless interactions, responsiveness, 24/7 accessibility, customization options and high levels of personalization,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a sense, they increasingly expect brands to know them.\u201d"}
