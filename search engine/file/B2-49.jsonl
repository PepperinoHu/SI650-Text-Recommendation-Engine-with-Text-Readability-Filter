As the Ice Bucket Challenge notched up $100m for a US motor-neurone- disease charity and \u00a34.5m for a British one, as well as thousands more for charities in Hong Kong and Australia, the bracing cold water of a backlash has quickly followed. \nNarcissistic celebrities showing off toned bodies, people having all the fun without donating, complaints about the waste of water \u2013 the attacks have come from commentators, animal-rights groups and environmentalists. And the US Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Association \u2013 which is not related to Britain\u2019s MND Association \u2013 also came under fire for the six-figure salaries being paid to its top staff. \nMeanwhile, the challenge continues to grow. For anyone unaware of how it works, someone gives a short speech to camera about the charity, then dumps a bucket of ice cubes in water over their head, or gets a friend to do it, before nominating three people to either do the same or donate. \nIt began in the US in July, although whether it was on a golf course or a baseball field depends on which version you prefer, and first appeared on mainstream American television on 15 July. But the ALS Association has now been forced to withdraw an attempt to patent the phrase \u201cIce Bucket Challenge\u201d after criticism. \u201cWe understand the public\u2019s concern and are withdrawing the trademark applications,\u201d spokeswoman Carrie Munk said. The ALS has yet to respond to criticism of its high overheads and wage bills. \nThe unfortunate coincidence that 31 August to 5 September was World Water Week, with international delegates arriving in Stockholm to discuss the planet\u2019s water crisis, has not been lost on some. The charity WaterAid is asking people to use recycled water from bathtubs or garden butts or to douse people with sea water. \nDouglas Graham, the MND Association\u2019s fundraising director, said: \u201cThe backlash is to be expected but, really, this is just a wonderful windfall and we\u2019re so grateful. We didn\u2019t see it coming but, suddenly, the donations just started.\u201d The boost is an enormous help to a small charity looking after sufferers of a debilitating, little- understood disease that has no cure and kills five people a day in the UK. \nFormer Baywatch star Pamela Anderson, a longstanding animal-rights activist, wrote an open letter to the ALS Association, saying she could not support its record on animal experimentation. A few US stars have rejected the challenge because of California\u2019s drought. Actor Matt Damon got around the problem by pulling up water from his toilets \u2013 pointing out that much of the world had less clean drinking water available. Actor Verne Troyer used milk, again citing environmental reasons. And the challenge has been blamed for causing a water shortage on the Scottish island of Colonsay after its 135 inhabitants picked up on the craze. \nIn Australia, a TV anchorman apologized over his robust \u201cno, thanks\u201d response to being nominated. Lincoln Humphries had said: \u201cInstead of pouring fresh water over your own head and wasting ice, here is a list of charities helping communities in desperate need of money across the world. I\u2019d like to nominate everyone, everywhere, who has more than they need, to donate what they can to the people who need it most \u2026 because that is what charity is about, not putting yourself through mild discomfort with a bucket of icy water.\u201d \nAnother criticism has been that small charities won\u2019t be able to cope with the extra cash, but the MND Association rejected this. \u201cOh, we can cope here,\u201d said Graham. \u201cWe fund world-class research into the causes and, ultimately, to find a treatment or cure. We provide care and support for 3,500 people and they need it because this is such a rapidly progressing disease and it\u2019s a costly one to manage. Over 50% die within two years of diagnosis. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see the decline in people we work with over just a few months.\u201d \nBut, for many people with a connection to the disease, the awareness that the challenge has created is as valuable as the cash. Graham says it is priceless. Normally, the MND Association gets around 300,000 hits a year on its website. On a single day recently, it had 330,000. \n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have created this if we\u2019d tried. Charities are all worthwhile causes and I understand even that some people might want to donate to a different one. In 2013, British people gave \u00a362bn to charity \u2013 we should be proud of that. It\u2019s fabulous for us to get this windfall. We\u2019ll be sitting down over the next few weeks to work out how to spend it in the best way but, I assure you, every penny will count for good.\u201d"}
