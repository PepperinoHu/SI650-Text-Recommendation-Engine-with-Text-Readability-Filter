{"id": "C2-1476", "contents": "\ufeffThe beginning of the year is probably prime-time for feeling glum about work: it\u2019s ages until the next holiday, and it\u2019s dark in the morning and when you get home. And, if you\u2019re stuck in a job you don\u2019t like, it could be enough to have you reaching for your CV. \nBut, before you start hunting through the job ads, try to put things in perspective. So, what else could you be doing instead? We asked \ufb01ve people doing some unusual jobs how much they are paid, what the worst parts are and why they enjoy their work. \n1. Dog-food taster \nThe job: Tasting dog food to make sure it meets a premium brand\u2019s quality standards \nWhat it involves: Opening sample tins of each freshly made batch of dog (or cat) food, smelling it and eating it. \u201cAlthough dogs\u2019 palates are different from ours, taste is an important quality check to ensure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced in just the right way,\u201d says Philip Wells, the chief taster for Lily\u2019s Kitchen pet food. \u201cTrying the food is also a good way to pick up on the nuances of the cooking; this works especially well on the dry food.\u201d \nTypical salary: \u00a320,000 for an entry-level job in the quality department. However, Wells says \u00a350,000 or more is \u201ceasily achievable\u201d for an experienced technical director who, as well as tasting products, is also likely to be responsible for developing new recipes and advising the business on technical and regulatory matters. Worst part of the job: The deadlines, for Wells, who admits he quite likes the food. The meat used in pet food has to be derived from animals passed as \ufb01 t for human consumption, under the Animal Feed Regulations 2010, and he says the \ufb01rm uses \u201chuman-grade freshly prepared raw food\u201d in its recipes. He adds: \u201cThere are some pretty gruesome pet foods out there and, although I don\u2019t taste them, the smell is enough to turn the stomach when I do a bit of market research.\u201d \nJob satisfaction: \u201cNo two days are ever the same.\u201d It\u2019s rewarding, Wells says, that a project he has worked on will \u201chelp pets to become happier and healthier\u201d. However, he acknowledges that some of the credit must go to another \u201ckey member\u201d of the tasting team: Lily, the border terrier. \n2. Hygiene technician \nThe job: Disinfecting areas that have potentially been exposed to bio-hazardous situations \nWhat it involves: Cleaning up crime scenes, road accidents and suicides. Clearing hoarders\u2019 houses full of rubbish, rats and excrement \u2026 among other things. \u201cThe job is about keeping people safe,\u201d says Richard Lewis, a hygiene technician for Rentokil. \u201cWe deal with some very disturbingly dirty sites.\u201d \nTypical salary: The entry-level salary is usually around \u00a314,500 and a top salary can be up to \u00a322,000. Worst part of the job: Cleaning up after suicides. \u201cYou get used to the job being disgusting but the emotional side of it is still hard.\u201d You learn not to take your work home with you, he says. \u201cYou also need to have a sense of humour, as some days can be tough.\u201d \nJob satisfaction: Lewis \ufb01nds the variety of tasks exciting. \u201cOne day, I\u2019m cleaning up after a dead body; another day, I\u2019m in a prison cell or 100 feet in the air being lowered down into a silo to clean it.\u201d He also takes pride in the transformation he brings about: \u201cIt\u2019s satisfying to return a potentially hazardous site back to a safe environment. And it bene \ufb01ts society.\u201d \n3. Biogas engineer \nThe job: Setting up biogas plants in developing countries \nWhat it involves: Linking a system of digesters \u2013 which can be \ufb01lled with human excrement, animal dung and other waste products \u2013 to toilets to produce a biogas that can be used for cooking and lighting. \u201cYou have to know what size and shape the mixing pit needs to be, how to create the optimum temperature for digestion and where to situate the biogas plant,\u201d says Baburam Paudel, chief technical of\ufb01cer in Nepal for the charity Renewable World. \u201cYou also have to convince poor communities that poo can be productive \u2013 many are repelled by the idea of connecting their toilets to their kitchens.\u201d \nTypical salary: An entry-level salary is around \u00a310,000, while a typical salary for a chief technical of\ufb01cer is \u00a330,000. Worst part of the job: For Paudel, it\u2019s seeing people struggling to survive on very little income. But, he admits, anyone who won\u2019t change a nappy would struggle. \u201cYou have to be willing to get your hands dirty during the build process and inspections. Unsurprisingly, the anaerobic digestion (the process that takes place when bacteria eat the decomposing waste and produce methane) smells like rotten eggs. It can be disgusting and there is no room for mistakes.\u201d \nJob satisfaction: \u201cI \ufb01nd it immensely satisfying to know that I am helping people to increase their incomes and allowing girls to attend school by replacing the need to collect \ufb01rewood,\u201d says Paudel. \u201cMy work improves the health and hygiene of whole communities.\u201d \n4. Eel ecologist \nThe job: Conserving the critically endangered European eel \nWhat it involves: To monitor the size of the endangered eels, ecologists wade into the Thames and other London rivers and marshes full of eels, sometimes up to their armpits, and reach into a net \ufb01lled with up to 20 adult eels to grab one with their bare hands. \u201cAdult eels can be a metre long, or even larger, and weigh up to 2kg. They\u2019re not at all dangerous but they are almost pure muscle and they can be a little bit slimy,\u201d says Stephen Mowat, an eel conservationist and ecologist for the Zoological Society of London. \u201cWe have to weigh and measure them, and they wriggle \u2026 a lot. It\u2019s dif\ufb01cult to look professional while crawling on the ground chasing an eel across the grass.\u201d \nWorst part of the job: \u201cEels are really tricky creatures to work with \u2013 and getting outsmarted by an eel can be quite embarrassing,\u201d says Mowat. \u201cYou also have to be ready to jump from one project to the next. I once had to dissect a tub of dead eels to examine parasites living in them, moments before jumping into a suit for a meeting with government of\ufb01cials. I remembered to wash my hands.\u201d But, for Mowat, the worst part of the job is de\ufb01nitely not handling the eels \u2013 he believes baby eels (known as elvers) are \u201cas cute as pandas\u201d: \u201cThe worst thing about the job is regularly learning how much damage we, the British population, are doing to the environment.\u201d \nJob satisfaction: \u201cGetting to work outdoors and seeing British wildlife up close is the best part of the job,\u201d says Mowat. \u201cEels are beautiful creatures and working with eels doesn\u2019t just bene \ufb01 t the eel: it helps whole river systems, estuaries and coastal habitats. That is something worth working on.\u201d \n5. Shopping channel presenter \nThe job: Selling and demonstrating a wide range of products on live TV \nWhat it involves: Presenting hours and hours of monotonous content, while simultaneously demonstrating the products and appearing to be enthusiastic and knowledgeable about everything that you\u2019re selling. \u201cI prepare and research as much technical and practical information as possible on every single product beforehand,\u201d says Shaun Ryan, presenter for Ideal World TV. \u201cBut you also need the ability to relate to every genre of products and to every viewer.\u201d \nTypical salary: A trainee presenter would start on a minimum of \u00a330,000, while an experienced presenter can expect over \u00a355,000. \nWorst part of the job: \u201cThe unsociable hours,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cAn experienced presenter like myself generally gets to work prime-time hours, which means all weekends, bank holidays and very late evenings, plus the occasional 5am shift.\u201d His worst task ever, he says, was singlehandedly having to sell some female slimming pants: \u201cIt was a very tricky hour and not my \ufb01 nest.\u201d \nJob satisfaction: \u201cI love the rush of live presenting and having to think on my feet every second,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cI also get an adrenaline rush from knowing that, at times, I have thousands of viewers ordering the product that I have just been presenting.\u201d"}
