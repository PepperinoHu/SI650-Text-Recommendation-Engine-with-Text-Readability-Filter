{"id": "C2-1402", "contents": "Like \u201crationalism\u201d and \u201cempiricism,\u201d \u201cexistentialism\u201d is a term that belongs to intellectual history. Its definition is thus to some extent one of historical convenience. The term was explicitly adopted as a self-description by Jean-Paul Sartre, and through the wide dissemination of the postwar literary and philosophical output of Sartre and his associates\u2014notably Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Albert Camus\u2014existentialism became identified with a cultural movement that flourished in Europe in the 1940s and 1950s. Among the major philosophers identified as existentialists (many of whom\u2014for instance Camus and Heidegger\u2014repudiated the label) were Karl Jaspers, Martin Heidegger, and Martin Buber in Germany, Jean Wahl and Gabriel Marcel in France, the Spaniards Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset and Miguel de Unamuno, and the Russians Nikolai Berdyaev and Lev Shestov. The nineteenth century philosophers, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, came to be seen as precursors of the movement. Existentialism was as much a literary phenomenon as a philosophical one. Sartre\u2019s own ideas were and are better known through his fictional works (such as Nausea and No Exit) than through his more purely philosophical ones (such as Being and Nothingness and Critique of Dialectical Reason), and the postwar years found a very diverse coterie of writers and artists linked under the term: retrospectively, Dostoevsky, Ibsen, and Kafka were conscripted; in Paris there were Jean Genet, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, and the expatriate Samuel Beckett; the Norwegian Knut Hamsun and the Romanian Eugene Ionesco belong to the club; artists such as Alberto Giacometti and even Abstract Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock, Arshile Gorky, and Willem de Kooning, and filmmakers such as Jean-Luc Godard and Ingmar Bergman were understood in existential terms. By the mid 1970s the cultural image of existentialism had become a clich\u00e9, parodized in countless books and films by Woody Allen.[1]\nIt is sometimes suggested, therefore, that existentialism just is this bygone cultural movement rather than an identifiable philosophical position; or, alternatively, that the term should be restricted to Sartre\u2019s philosophy alone.[2] Two recent books, both of them sustained attempts to engage critically and constructively with existentialism in the context of contemporary philosophical debates, adopt versions of these stances. Jonathan Webber argues that \u201cas originally defined by Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, existentialism is the ethical theory that we ought to treat the freedom at the core of human existence as intrinsically valuable and the foundation of all other values\u201d (2018: 2). If we stick to this definition, we can both recognize the fissures within what is called \u201cexistentialism\u201d in the expansive sense and also see how existentialism can \u201cground sophisticated contributions to social psychology, philosophy of mind, moral philosophy, cultural theory, and psychotherapy\u201d (2018: 19). Taking up the other stance, Noreen Khawaja notes the perennial difficulty in specifying just who is supposed to belong to the \u201cmovement\u201d of existentialism, given that the term itself was either unknown to some who are conscripted or outright rejected by others. But, she argues, this is a problem only if existentialism is taken to be a movement. Though aspects of such a movement can be found in the historical record, existentialism itself \u201cis a tradition, not a movement\u201d; that is, \u201ca pattern of intergenerational influence, in which later figures read and appropriated the work of earlier figures\u201d (Khawaja 2016: 4). What animates this tradition\u2014exemplified here by Kierkegaard, Heidegger, and Sartre\u2014is its struggle with religion and the fact that the writing of even so-called \u201catheist\u201d existentialists \u201cfeels religious to its readers\u201d (2016: 16). Interestingly, taking either stance leads to the same place: For Khawaja, \u201cthe idea of personal authenticity [is] at the center of existential thought\u201d (2016: 24), while for Webber, the existentialism of Sartre, Beauvoir, and Franz Fanon begins with \u201ceudaimonist arguments for the virtue of authenticity\u201d and finally affirms \u201ca categorial moral imperative of authenticity\u201d (2018: 19).\nIn this entry, I will employ elements of both approaches. Like Khawaja, I take existentialism to be a usefully broad term of intellectual history that can illuminate the work of philosophers and others who preceded the rise of the \u201cmovement\u201d or rejected the label. In this sense, \u201cexistentialism\u201d picks out a distinctive cluster of philosophical problems and a relatively distinct current of twentieth- and now twenty-first-century philosophical inquiry, one that has had significant impact on fields such as theology (through Rudolf Bultmann, Paul Tillich, Karl Barth, and others) and psychology (from Ludwig Binswanger and Medard Boss to Otto Rank, R. D. Laing, and Viktor Frankl). On the other hand, I do not think that the \u201ctradition\u201d of existential thought should be approached exclusively in terms of the (very real) struggle with religion that gives some of the works of existential philosophy a religious \u201cfeel\u201d (but see Westphal 2012). I agree with Webber that there is a core of philosophical (categorial) content to existential thought that can be understood independently of the sort of religious \u201crhetoric\u201d (Khawaja 2016: 16) characteristic of many of the classics of existentialism. Unlike Webber, however, I think that this categorial content is quite widely shared\u2014beyond Sartre, Beauvoir, and Fanon\u2014and must be understood as grounded in the phenomenological approach that so excited Sartre (see Crowell 2012b). The phenomenological approach gave philosophical shape to the basic existential insight that thinking about human existence requires new categories not found in the conceptual repertoire of ancient or modern thought; human beings can be understood neither as substances with fixed properties, nor as subjects interacting with a world of objects.\nOn the existential view, to understand what a human being is it is not enough to know all the truths that natural science\u2014including the science of psychology\u2014could tell us. The dualist who holds that human beings are composed of independent substances\u2014\u201cmind\u201d and \u201cbody\u201d\u2014is no better off in this regard than is the physicalist who holds that human existence can be adequately explained in terms of the fundamental physical constituents of the universe. Existentialism does not deny the validity of the basic categories of physics, biology, psychology, and the other sciences (categories such as matter, causality, force, function, organism, development, motivation, and so on). It claims only that human beings cannot be fully understood in terms of them. Nor can such an understanding be gained by supplementing our scientific picture with a moral one. Categories of moral theory such as intention, blame, responsibility, character, duty, virtue, and the like do capture important aspects of the human condition, but neither moral thinking (governed by the norms of the good and the right) nor scientific thinking (governed by the norm of truth) suffices.\n\u201cExistentialism\u201d, therefore, may be defined as the philosophical theory which holds that a further set of categories, governed by the norm of authenticity, is necessary to grasp human existence. To approach existentialism in this categorial way may seem to conceal what is often taken to be its \u201cheart\u201d (Kaufmann 1968: 12), namely, its character as a gesture of protest against academic philosophy, its anti-system sensibility, its flight from the \u201ciron cage\u201d of reason. But while it is true that the major existential philosophers wrote with a passion and urgency rather uncommon in our own time, and while the idea that philosophy cannot be practiced in the disinterested manner of an objective science is indeed central to existentialism, it is equally true that all the themes popularly associated with existentialism\u2014dread, boredom, alienation, the absurd, freedom, commitment, nothingness, and so on\u2014find their philosophical significance in the context of the search for a new categorial framework, together with its governing norm."}
