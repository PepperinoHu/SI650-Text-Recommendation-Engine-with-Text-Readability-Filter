Is it for a school project?\nYes, I'm doing an essay on the life of a tiger.\nYou're going to want one with a lot of words and less pictures.\nBut I want the one with pictures!\nPictures are pretty, but they won't help you with your essay that much.\nFine, I admit you're right.\nYou can borrow the book with pictures for your own pleasure.\nYay! I love tigers.\nI have a book that isn't hard to understand, but still has great information.\nGreat! You're so helpful.\nIt's my job to be helpful."}
