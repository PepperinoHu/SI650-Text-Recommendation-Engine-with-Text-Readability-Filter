{"id": "C2-1490", "contents": "Light propagating in the vicinity of astrophysical compact objects, like neutron stars and black holes, is affected by the gravitational field. It has been demonstrated that the general relativistic effects might be important for understanding the features of the radiation\ncoming from the neutron star like objects [1, 2, 3]. The\ngravitational redshift and bending of light rays emitted\nby a compact object affect the form and spectrum of the\nobserved signals. For the emission of light from the vicinity of a black hole these effects are more profound than\nfor neutron stars. For example, the line broadening of Xray observed by the ASCA satellite can be explained by\nthe strong gravitational effect on the light emitted from\nthe accretion disk located near to the central black hole\n[4, 5].\nAstrophysical black holes are believed to be formed\nas a result of the gravitational collapse of massive stars\n[6]. Then it is natural to expect that the radiation emitted during the gravitational collapse is also affected by\nthe strong gravity. For a spherical collapse and continuous emission of light this effect was studied in details\n[7, 8, 9]. Recently the light curves for collapsing objects\nwere studied in a slightly different set up [10] assuming\nthat the radiation has a profile of a sharp in time pulse.\nSuch radiation may occur during the collapse of a star\nwhen its matter density becomes much higher than the\nnuclear density. Under these conditions hadronic phase\ntransitions are expected [11] which may result in sharpin-time emission of massless particles (photons and neutrino) [12].\nIn this work, we consider the radiation emitted by a\ncollapsing star during a finite time interval and calculate\nlight curves and the spectrum of this radiation as seen by\na distant observer. As in the previous work [10], we adopt\na simplified model of a freely falling spherical surface and\nassume that the radiation is originally monochromatic.\nBut instead of instant radiation, we focus on the radiation emitted during the finite interval of time. The main\ngoal of this study is to analyze how one can extract information about the characteristics of a collapsing object\n(its mass and radius) from the observed spectra and light\ncurves."}
