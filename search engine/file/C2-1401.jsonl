{"id": "C2-1401", "contents": "\ufeffIt is hard to tell exactly where the noise is coming from, but impossible to miss it from anywhere in Damascus: all day and night you can hear the dull thud and boom of artillery, rockets or planes pounding rebel positions \u2013 the sound of war getting closer to Syria\u2019s capital. But just over two years into the Syrian crisis \u2013 the longest and bloodiest of the Arab uprisings \u2013 ignoring the sound of death and destruction nearby has become the new normal for Damascenes. \nOver the weekend, men could be seen puffing on water pipes in a palm-shaded park, children playing between the flowerbeds and couples chatting on benches as the unmistakable thunderclap of high explosive could be heard a few miles away \u2013 smoke rising between the minarets of a nearby Ottoman-era mosque. No one seemed to notice. \n\u201cActually you do get used to it after a while,\u201d said George, an IT technician from a village on the coast. \u201cBut you never know exactly what they are hitting.\u201d That usually becomes clear later from video clips posted by opposition media outlets on YouTube. \nThe sinister background noise is doubly disturbing because the government tries so hard to preserve a jaunty air of business as usual. \u201cAs you can see, everything here is fine but we have to hit the terrorists, these extremists,\u201d an army officer announced. An official, whose route home has come under attack from rebels in Daraya, said: \u201cIf I was afraid, I would just shut my door and stay inside. I have to work and I am not afraid. If I don\u2019t defend my country, who will?\u201d \nOrdinary citizens, in private conversation, are less defiant. In the centre of town, a shopkeeper complained sadly that his baby daughter cries at the sound of shelling. Zeina, a twenty-something student, fears becoming desensitized to suffering \u2013 and perhaps to danger too. \u201cIn the beginning, when there started to be explosions, I used to have nightmares,\u201d she reflected. \u201cNow I can sleep through anything.\u201d \nAnd, the risks are multiplying even closer to home. In Sabaa Bahrat Square, in what was supposed to be the safest part of Damascus, a car bomb detonated, leaving a blackened concrete facade, broken windows and mangled metal as well as blast damage to the imposing structure of the Syrian Central Bank next door. Mourning notices for two of the 15 victims \u2013 Muhammad al-Sufi and Manal al-Tahan \u2013 are stuck to the wall opposite. Scruffy, machine-gun toting militiamen mill around the square, often used for televised pro-regime rallies with civil servants bussed in en masse to chant slogans under giant banners of President Bashar al-Assad. \nThat bombing was not the worst Damascus has experienced as the situation has deteriorated. In February, 80 people, including schoolchildren, reportedly died near the ruling Ba\u2019ath Party headquarters in Mazraa. The crater is still visible, marked by an enormous patch of fresh asphalt on the main road going north. \u201cI live nearby but luckily I wasn\u2019t there,\u201d recalled Munir, a university lecturer. \nMortar bombs, fired from rebel-held areas now within easy range of the city, have become an ominous novelty. The bombs killed 15 students in a university cafeteria on 28 March. The intended target is thought to have been a government building. \nSecurity measures have intensified since the devastating bombing of the national security crisis cell in July 2012, when four of Assad\u2019s most senior aides were killed. Concrete blast barriers \u2013 often painted in the Syrian flag\u2019s black, red and white \u2013 now protect official premises, not just the military or defence installations that are obvious targets. The Iranian Embassy in Mezze, its turquoise mosaic front giving an exotic glimpse of Isfahan or Shiraz, looks like a fortress. \u201cThe regime did manage to set up a ring of steel round Damascus,\u201d a foreign diplomat said. \u201cBut for whatever reason the perimeter is starting to be punctured and that brings home the reality of the war.\u201d \nAll this means that moving around has become difficult, unpredictable and time-consuming \u2013 another aspect of the new normal across an understandably nervous city. Checkpoints on main roads funnel traffic for ID checks and baggage searches with handheld explosive detectors \u2013 vital to stop future bombers. Only drivers with an official security clearance can use special fast lanes to avoid the wait. \nIt is hard, however, to avoid the question on everyone\u2019s mind: will there be a battle for Damascus \u2013 the world\u2019s oldest continually inhabited city, as the guidebooks say \u2013 like the one that has so damaged Aleppo? Parts of the city already feel like a war zone: its ritziest hotel is eerily deserted though many rooms are being used as offices by international agencies drawn by the deepening crisis \u2013 blue helmets and flak jackets piled up on Persian carpets in an ornate reception room, white UN vehicles parked behind the blast barriers outside. The streets empty soon after 9pm. \nOne view is that the fight for Syria\u2019s capital is coming, but not quite yet \u2013 in the summer perhaps, some predict, when the rebels have consolidated their gains in the south. Others argue that outright victory by either side is unlikely and hope for a political solution imposed from abroad. But few here seem to expect things to get any better."}
