As part of his series, \u2019If Our Bodies Could Talk\u2019, Hamblin, a relatively sane- looking man, took on a no-showering challenge to examine the effect of over-cleansing the body. He reduced the number of showers he had and eliminated shampoo and soap when he did. In doing so, he discovered what thousands of others have: the more we fervently try to clean ourselves with soaps, body washes and those silly little body polishers, the harder our skin works to restore equilibrium, encouraging us to begin the whole bewildering process again. Showering strips the skin of its own oil and bacteria \u2013 which, many would argue, is the whole point of showering \u2013 but, apparently, this sometimes works a little too well, especially when you add hot water and cleansing products to the mix. \nYou know that feeling after a shower when you feel like you\u2019re stuck in a skin suit two sizes too small? That\u2019s because much of your skin\u2019s natural moisture has been washed down the drain. Additionally, our skin, much like our gut, plays host to millions of beneficial bacteria. Showering destroys these happy bacterial colonies; they\u2019re completely wiped out by all of our frequent rubbing and scrubbing. And, when the bacteria washed off by soap repopulate, they tend to favour microbes which produce an odour \u2013 yes, too-frequent showering may actually make you smell more. When you stop showering and using soap, however, your skin goes through an initial (likely gross) adjustment period, after which the skin typically restores balance, oil production slows and healthy bacteria flourish. \nAfter everything was said and done, Hamblin realized what other no-soap/no-shower devotees have known for years: that the human body, functioning on its own, is actually quite lovely. It\u2019s not just scent or aesthetics, either \u2013 although dermatologists suggest that slowing down on soap use can improve acne and eczema. \nReducing the frequency of showers (and the number of cleansing products used) has very real implications for our environment. The average shower lasts seven minutes and uses 65 litres of water. That\u2019s 65 litres of clean, drinkable water that we\u2019re infusing with soap and washing down the drain each and every day \u2013 sometimes more than once. \nThe vital importance of clean water is becoming harder and harder to ignore, as California enters another summer of drought. It\u2019s becoming clear that clean water is one of the world\u2019s most valuable commodities and one that will soon be in short supply. Add in the environmental effect of all those body wash bottles and you\u2019ve got yourself a handful of very compelling reasons to let your body go au naturel. \nIf this whole thing is giving you the heebie-jeebies as you recall the last time you were cheek by jowl with those who evidently already skimp on the showers \u2013 and have clearly not reached the scent-free stage yet \u2013 relax. Many cleansing- reduction enthusiasts still use deodorant if they find it necessary (everyone\u2019s natural scent varies in intensity and can be affected by a host of factors including diet, hydration and exercise) and hand-washing with soap is still recommended as a vital way to reduce the spread of infectious diseases. \nYou don\u2019t need to go cold turkey, as Hamblin did, but in between thrice-daily disinfecting sessions and giving up showers altogether there lies room for our familiar, simple advice. Reduce. Skip a few showers, put down the soap and let those lovely little bacteria flourish a little, would you?"}
