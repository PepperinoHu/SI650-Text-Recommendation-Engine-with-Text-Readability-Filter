The great man stares northwards across the square at an almost sheer mountainside in front of him. \nBehind him, to the south, rises the equally sheer 1,800-metre peak known as Gaustatoppen. Between the mountains, along the narrow Vestfjord valley, lies the small, but once mighty, town that Eyde built in the early years of the last century, to house the workers for his factories. \nEyde harnessed the power of the 100-metre Rjukanfossen waterfall to generate hydroelectricity in what was, at the time, the world\u2019s biggest power plant. \nBut one thing he couldn\u2019t do was change the elevation of the sun. Deep in its east \u2013west valley, surrounded by high mountains, Rjukan and its 3,400 inhabitants are in shadow for half the year. During the day, from late September to mid-March, the town, three hours north-west of Oslo, is not completely dark, but it\u2019s certainly not bright, either. \nRecently, however, Eyde\u2019s statue has gazed out upon a sight that even he might have found startling. High on the mountain opposite, 450 metres above the town, three large, solar-powered, computer-controlled mirrors steadily track the movement of the sun across the sky, reflecting its rays down on to the square and bathing it in bright sunlight. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the sun!\u201d grins Ingrid Sparbo, disbelievingly, lifting her face to the light and closing her eyes. A retired secretary, Sparbo has lived all her life in Rjukan and says people \u201cdo sort of get used to the shade. You end up not thinking about it, really. But this ... this is so warming. Not just physically, but mentally. It\u2019s mentally warming.\u201d \nTwo young mothers wheel their children into the square and stand in the sun. On a freezing day, an elderly couple sit on one of the new benches, smiling at the warmth on their faces. Children beam. Lots of people take photographs. A shop assistant, Silje Johansen, says it\u2019s \u201cawesome. Just awesome.\u201d \nPushing his child\u2019s buggy, electrical engineer Eivind Toreid is more cautious. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing,\u201d he says. \u201cNot real sunlight, but very like it. Like a spotlight.\u201d \nHeidi Fieldheim says she heard all about it on the radio. \u201cBut it\u2019s far more than I expected,\u201d she says. \u201cThis will bring much happiness.\u201d \nAcross the road, in the Nye Tider caf\u00e9, sits the man responsible for this unexpected access to happiness. Martin Andersen is a 40-year-old artist who moved to Rjukan in the summer of 2001. \nThe first inkling of an artwork Andersen called the Solspeil , or Sun mirror , came to him as the month of September began to fade: \u201cEvery day, we would take our young child for a walk in the buggy,\u201d he says, \u201cand, every day, I realized we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun.\u201d By 28 September, the sun completely disappears from Rjukan\u2019s market square. It doesn\u2019t reappear until 12 March. \nThroughout the seemingly endless intervening months, Andersen says, \u201cWe\u2019d look up and see blue sky above, and the sun high on the mountain slopes, but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town. It\u2019s sad, a town that people have to leave in order to feel the sun.\u201d \nTwelve years after he first dreamed of his Solspeil, a German company specializing in so-called CSP \u2013 concentrated solar power \u2013 helicoptered in the three 17-sq-m glass mirrors that now stand high above the market square in Rjukan. \u201cIt took,\u201d he says, \u201ca bit longer than we\u2019d imagined.\u201d \nIt really works. There were objectors \u2013 and plenty of them \u2013 petitions and letter-writing campaigns and a Facebook page organized against what a large number of locals saw initially as a vanity project and, above all, a waste of money. But even they now seem largely won over. \n\u201cI was strongly against it,\u201d admits Nils Eggerud. Like many others, he felt the money could have been better spent elsewhere \u2013 on a couple of extra carers to look after Rjukan\u2019s old people, perhaps, or improved school facilities, cycle paths, a bit of rural road resurfacing. \n\u201cAnd I still have my doubts about the ongoing maintenance costs,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat will they be, who will pay them? But ... well, it does feel nice, standing here. And, really, you just have to look at the people\u2019s faces.\u201d \nIn his office overlooking the square, Rjukan\u2019s energetic young mayor, Steinar Bergsland, is interested not so much in the cost but in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town. \nAlready, Bergsland says, visitor numbers are up for the time of year and Rjukan\u2019s shopkeepers have reported their takings following suit. A hi-tech company is interested in relocating to Rjukan, attracted by the cutting-edge technology on view at the top of the mountain and the publicity it has attracted. \n\u201cThis is a powerful symbol for Rjukan,\u201d Bergsland says, and, helped by assorted government grants and a donation from a local business, the town needed to find just 1m krone \u2013 \u00a3100,000 \u2013 of the mirrors\u2019 total 5m-krone cost. \nAnd, seen against the town\u2019s 650m krone annual budget, he points out, 1m krone really wasn\u2019t very much to pay for something that \u201cgives us a far, far better chance of raising the money we need for better schools and more nursing care. And just look out of the window. Look at those happy faces. Now it\u2019s actually here, people love it.\u201d"}
