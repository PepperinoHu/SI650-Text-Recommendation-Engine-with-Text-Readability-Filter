Bolivia has obtained a special exemption from the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the framework that governs international drugs policy, allowing its indigenous people to chew the leaves. \nBolivia had argued that the convention was in opposition to its new constitution, adopted in 2009, which obliges it to \u201cprotect native and ancestral coca as cultural patrimony\u201d and maintains that coca \u201cin its natural state \u2026 is not a narcotic\u201d. \nSouth American Indians have chewed coca leaves for centuries. The leaves reputedly provide energy and are said to have medicinal qualities. Supporters of Bolivia\u2019s position praised it for standing up for the rights of indigenous people. \u201cThe Bolivian move is inspirational and groundbreaking,\u201d said Danny Kushlick, Head of External Affairs at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, which promotes drug liberalization. \u201cIt shows that any country that has had enough of the war on drugs can change the terms of its engagement with the UN conventions.\u201d \nHowever, the UN\u2019s International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), which monitors implementation of the global drug treaties, has accused Bolivia of threatening the integrity of the international drug control regime. A number of countries \u2013 including the UK, the US, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Russia \u2013 opposed Bolivia\u2019s demands. \nThe UK\u2019s submission to the UN, which oversees the convention, said that it \u201cacknowledges and respects the cultural importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia\u201d, but it adds: \u201cThe United Kingdom is \u2026 concerned that the reservation could lead to increases in coca production and \u2013 crucially \u2013 the amount of coca diverted to the cocaine trade. As such, the reservation would weaken international law as it relates to the global effort to tackle the drugs trade and could weaken the international community\u2019s response to that trade.\u201d \nThe right of indigenous communities in South America\u2019s Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed up to the convention. But, under the terms of the agreement, Bolivia was given 25 years to implement the ban. This expired in 1989 and since then the issue has been under dispute. \nIn 2011, Bolivia \u2013 whose President, Evo Morales, is a former coca producer \u2013 formally notified the UN of its withdrawal from the convention. On Friday it reacceded to the convention, but with an exemption from the prohibition on the chewing of coca leaves. \nThe move is the first of its kind in the history of UN drug-control treaties and has sparked concerns that other countries may apply for amendments. The Russian government has argued that the move will lead to \u201can increase in illegal circulation of cocaine\u201d and warned that \u201cit also sets a dangerous precedent that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drug-control regime\u201d. \nThe British parliament\u2019s Home Affairs Select Committee has recommended that Bolivia\u2019s request should be backed by the UK government, arguing that it was important that countries remained within the single convention. Bolivia\u2019s re-accession could be blocked only if a third or more of the 184 countries that have signed up to the convention opposed its request. There are suspicions that the US and UK are frantically lobbying other countries to gain sufficient numbers to block Bolivia\u2019s request. \nNancie Prud\u2019homme, Projects Director at the International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy, criticized the co-ordinated opposition to Bolivia\u2019s demands. \u201cThese objections are legally questionable,\u201d she said. \u201cThey support an arbitrary and over-broad provision and apply international drug laws in a vacuum. This is not appropriate. No state has paid any attention to decades of developing international norms on cultural and indigenous rights, which support Bolivia\u2019s efforts.\u201d \nThe decision to ban coca chewing was based on a 1950 report produced by the UN Commission of Inquiry on the Coca Leaf, which proponents of drug liberalization say was not based on supporting evidence. In an interview in 1949, the head of the Commission, Howard B Fonda, signalled his opposition to the chewing of coca leaves before his inquiry had begun. Fonda told an interviewer: \u201cWe believe that the daily, inveterate use of coca leaves by chewing \u2026 is not only thoroughly noxious and therefore detrimental, but is also the cause of racial degeneration in many centres of population, and of the decadence that visibly shows in numerous Indians \u2026 Our studies will confirm the certainty of our assertions and we hope we can present a rational plan of action \u2026 to attain the absolute and sure abolition of this pernicious habit.\u201d \nThe growing of coca leaves is legal and licensed in Bolivia. The policy has been credited with a fall in cocaine production in the country, leading some experts to see the Bolivian model as a way forward for other countries."}
