{"id": "B2-205", "contents": "\ufeffHe arrived \u2013 in his own words, in 2005 \u2013 as \u201ca simple, humble worker in God\u2019s vineyard\u201d. And on a grey, cold, blustery Monday in February, Pope Benedict XVI signed off in the same fashion: like an elderly labourer who can no longer ignore the pains in his back; who can no more count on the strength of his arms. Characteristically for this most traditionally minded of pontiffs, he made his excuses in Latin. The first German pope in modern times timed his departure to the minute. \u201cFrom 28 February 2013, at 20.00 hours\u201d, he told a gathering of cardinals in the Vatican, \u201cthe see of Rome, the see of Saint Peter, will be vacant and a conclave to elect the new supreme pontiff will have to be convoked by those whose competence it is.\u201d \nAmong those present was a Mexican prelate, Monsignor Oscar Sanch\u00e9z Barba, from Guadalajara. He was in Rome to be told the date for a canonization in which he has played a leading role. \u201cWe were all in the Sala del Concistoro in the third loggia of the Apostolic Palace,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter giving the date for the canonization, the twelfth of May, the Pope took a sheet of paper and read from it. \n\u201cWe were all left \u2026\u201d \u2013 Sanch\u00e9z Barba looked around him in the Bernini colonnade that embraces St Peter\u2019s Square, grasping for the word, as speechless as the \u201cprinces of the church\u201d who had just heard the man they believe to be God\u2019s representative on earth give up on the job. \u201cThe cardinals were just looking at one another,\u201d Sanch\u00e9z Barba said. \nAngelo Sodano, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, who must have been forewarned, delivered a brief and perhaps hurriedly composed speech. Before going on to assure the Pope of the cardinals\u2019 loyalty and devotion, he said he and the others present had \u201clistened to you with a sense of bewilderment, almost completely incredulous \u201d. At the end of his address, the Pope blessed those present, and left. \u201cIt was so simple; the simplest thing imaginable,\u201d said Sanch\u00e9z Barba. \u201cThen we all left in silence. There was absolute silence \u2026 and sadness.\u201d \nJohn Thavis, who spent 30 years reporting on the Holy See and whose book, The Vatican Diaries, is soon to be published, said he had had an intuition the Pope might be about to resign and timed his return to Rome from the US accordingly. A fellow-Vatican watcher confirmed this to be the case. Thavis noted that in the book-length interview Benedict gave to a German journalist, published as Light of the World in 2010, he had made it clear he considered it would be right to go if he felt he were no longer up to the job. \u201cI asked myself: if I were Pope and wanted to resign, when would I choose? He has completed his series of books and most of his projects are off the ground. What is more, there were no dates in his calendar of events he personally had to attend. I thought the most likely date was 22 February, which is the Feast of the Chair of St Peter. So I got it wrong.\u201d \nThe line emerging from the Vatican within hours of the announcement was that the Pope\u2019s decision was a brave one. By this account, Benedict \u2013 never one to shrink from utterances and decisions that shocked \u2013 had taken it upon himself to bring his church face to face with reality: the reality that contemporary medicine can keep men alive far beyond the age at which they are up to grappling with the demands of running a vast global organization. Thavis agreed: \u201cWhat I find particularly courageous is that he is prepared to say now, when he is not sick, that he is going; and that he\u2019s doing it because he\u2019s tired and not because he\u2019s particularly ill.\u201d But is that the whole story? Does he know more about his state of health than the Vatican has so far made public? \nBenedict\u2019s own account of his reasons makes it clear that he took into account not only his physical, but also his psychological condition: \u201cIn order to govern the bark of Saint Peter and proclaim the Gospel, both strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me.\u201d Other theories will no doubt swirl around the Vatican in the days and weeks ahead, just as they did following the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978, 33 days after his election. Already there is speculation that something was about to come out about Benedict\u2019s past. The Vatican will just as predictably dismiss such notions with contempt. But they are understandable all the same, for the transcendental importance of what Benedict has done cannot be overstated. \nEmerging from St Peter\u2019s Basilica, Julia Rochester, from London, who described herself as a lapsed Catholic, was still turning over the implications of the Pope\u2019s resignation. \u201cIf you\u2019re God\u2019s chosen one, how do you choose not be chosen?\u201d she mused. It is a question many practising Catholics will be asking of their priests in the weeks ahead. In his first speech as Pope \u2013 humbly disclaiming his fitness for the task \u2013 Benedict said: \u201cI am consoled by the fact that the Lord knows how to work and how to act, even with insufficient tools.\u201d At some point in the last eight years, it would seem, he ceased to believe that was true."}
