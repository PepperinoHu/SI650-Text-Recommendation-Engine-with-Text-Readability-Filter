He gave me an F, because I double spaced my essay!\nBut every professor wants essays double spaced. He's crazy!\nProfessor Hernandez is weird. He wants essays triple spaced.\nThat's just a waste of paper. Why does he like triple spacing?\nHe says it's because he has to make a lot of corrections, because we're stupid.\nWe should start a petition, and get him fired!\nWe should, but he can find out.\nI know. If he found out, he would ruin everyone's life.\nHe is so evil.\nThat's why this petition has to work!"}
