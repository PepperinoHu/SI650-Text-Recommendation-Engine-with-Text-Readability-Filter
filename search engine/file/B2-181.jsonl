{"id": "B2-181", "contents": "\ufeffScarlett Johansson is suing a French novelist for \u20ac50,000 in damages, alleging that his work of fiction makes fraudulent claims about her personal life. \nLa Premiere chose qu\u2019on regarde (The First Thing We Look At) by Gr\u00e9goire Delacourt tells the story of a French model who looks so similar to the American actor that the book\u2019s lead male character thinks it is Johansson herself. In the novel, the model\u2019s looks mean that men see her only as a sex object, while women are jealous of her. She has a series of adventures as Johansson until she is eventually found out and, in the end, dies in a car crash. \nJohansson herself is not flattered by the best- selling literary work. Her lawyer, Vincent Toledano, told Le Figaro that Delacourt\u2019s novel constituted a \u201cviolation and fraudulent and illegal exploitation of her name, her reputation and her image.\u201d He said the novel contains \u201cdefamatory claims about her private life\u201d and has now gone to court to try to stop the book being translated or adapted for cinema. The court case began in Paris on Wednesday afternoon, though neither Johansson nor Delacourt was present. \n\u201cThe freedom of expression that she defends as an artist is not in question,\u201d Toledano said. \u201cSuch activities for purely mercantile ends have nothing to do with creativity.\u201d \nDelacourt has tried explaining that he chose to reference Johansson because she is \u201cthe archetype of beauty today.\u201d He said: \u201cI wrote a work of fiction. My character is not Scarlett Johansson.\u201d \nThe author recently hit out against the actor on French radio, saying the legal action was \u201crather sad\u201d. He said: \u201cIt freaks me out to think that, when you talk of a character in a novel, judges can get involved.\u201d \nDelacourt has become one of France\u2019s best-loved authors; his previous novel, My List of Desires, was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a film. But he said he was \u201cspeechless\u201d when he found out Johansson was suing him. \n\u201cI thought she\u2019d get in contact to ask me to go for a coffee with her. I didn\u2019t write a novel about a celebrity,\u201d he said. \u201cI wrote a real love story and a homage to feminine beauty, especially interior beauty. \n\u201cIf an author can no longer mention the things that surround us \u2013 a brand of beer, a monument, an actor \u2013 it\u2019s going to be complicated to produce fiction. \n\u201cIt\u2019s stupefying, especially as I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s even read the novel, since it hasn\u2019t been translated yet.\u201d \nEmmanuelle Allibert, spokeswoman for publisher JC Latt\u00e8s, said taking legal action was \u201ccrazy\u201d. \u201cWe have never known anything like it. It is all the more surprising for the fact that the novel is not even about Scarlett Johansson. It is about a woman who is Scarlett Johansson\u2019s double.\u201d \nDelacourt\u2019s lawyer, Anne Veil, who is also representing publisher JC Latt\u00e8s, said the allegations were \u201ctotally scandalous\u201d. \u201cThis is a literary, not commercial, approach. She has not been used as a product,\u201d she said. \u201cGr\u00e9goire Delacourt is not a paparazzo; he\u2019s a writer!\u201d \nIronically, the author\u2019s legal situation would be far easier had he published the book in Johansson\u2019s home country, rather than France. Lloyd Jassin, a New York intellectual property lawyer, told Time that the case would be unlikely to be considered in the United States because the book would be protected by the First Amendment. \n\u201cThe First Amendment doesn\u2019t look at most books as commercial uses or commercial propositions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf her name or likeness is relevant, literarily, if there\u2019s significance and literary merit to using her name between the covers, the First Amendment steps in.\u201d However, in France, the legal position is more complicated and personality rights are taken \u201cmuch more seriously,\u201d Jassin says. \n\u201cI thought she might send me flowers as it was a declaration of love for her, but she didn\u2019t understand,\u201d Delacourt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange paradox \u2013 but a very American one.\u201d"}
