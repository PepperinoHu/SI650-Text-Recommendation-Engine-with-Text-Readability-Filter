Instead, Enric Duran handed the money out to projects that created and promoted alternatives to capitalism. \nAfter 14 months in hiding, Duran is unapologetic, even though his activities could land him in jail. \u201cI\u2019m proud of what I did,\u201d he said in an interview by Skype from an undisclosed location. The money, he said, had created opportunities. \u201cIt generated a movement that allowed us to push forward with the construction of alternatives. And it allowed us to build a powerful network that groups together these initiatives.\u201d \nFrom 2006 to 2008, Duran took out 68 commercial and personal loans from 39 banks in Spain. He farmed the money out to social activists, funding speaking tours against capitalism and TV cameras for a media network. \u201cI saw that, on one side, these social movements were building alternatives but that they lacked resources and communication capacities,\u201d he said. \u201cMeanwhile, our reliance on perpetual growth was creating a system that created money out of nothing.\u201d \nThe loans he swindled from banks were his way of regulating and denouncing this situation, he said. He started slowly. \u201cI filled out a few credit applications with my real details. They denied me, but I just wanted to get a feel for what they were asking for.\u201d \nFrom there, the former table-tennis coach began to weave an intricate web of accounts, payments and transfers. \u201cI was learning constantly.\u201d By the summer of 2007, he had discovered how to make the system work, applying for loans under the name of a false television production company. \u201cThen, I managed to get a lot.\u201d \u20ac492,000, to be exact. \nDuran was arrested in Spain in 2009, on charges brought against him by six of the 39 banks that had lent him money. He spent two months in prison before being bailed for \u20ac50,000. In February 2013, facing up to eight years in prison, he decided to flee rather than stand trial. \u201cI don\u2019t see legitimacy in a judicial system based on authority, because I don\u2019t recognize its authority,\u201d he said. \nHis actions, he said, were in the vanguard of a worldwide debate on the economic crisis. The timing pushed the anti-capitalist movement into the light, just as many Spaniards were seeking alternatives to a system that had wreaked havoc on their lives. \nWhile the same actions would probably be better understood in today\u2019s Spain, he said that they would not be needed. The anti-capitalist movement has grown from a fringe movement to one supported by thousands of Spaniards, he said, evidenced by the widely supported movements such as the Indignados. \nSuccess has helped the movement become self- sufficient. \u201cWe now have the capacity to generate resources,\u201d said Duran, adding somewhat ironically that this was exactly what banks issue credit for \u2013 \u201cto advance and generate a situation that allows you to be independent\u201d. Duran is widening his focus to include Spain\u2019s justice system, by promoting restorative justice. \u201cThe people in Spain who believe that banks don\u2019t work, they think that I don\u2019t owe anything. I\u2019ve already done my work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is a part of a population that is not in agreement with us and I think I should respond to that.\u201d \nIn his case, he said, the element of reciprocity he could offer to banks might lie in the insight he gleaned from years of obtaining bank loans fraudulently. He could share his thoughts on \u201cwhich best practices work and the bad ones that don\u2019t,\u201d he suggested, \u201cfor the general population and for bank workers\u201d."}
