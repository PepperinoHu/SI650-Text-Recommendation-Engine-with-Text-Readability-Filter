What else?\nShe never takes a shower.\nThat's disgusting! You should tell her to take a shower.\nI did! She got mad at me and then proceeded to slap me.\nOuch! Did you try to get a new roommate?\nI tried, but I could not. No one was willing to switch.\nI guess you can get a new room by yourself.\nI can't afford it. Ugh, I hate her so much.\nIt's okay. The year will be over before you know it."}
