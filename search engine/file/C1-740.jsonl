In the second \u2013 a marketing shot after she became famous \u2013 she seems paler. Whether this was the result of whitening products and cosmetic surgery or \u2013 more likely \u2013 Photoshop tweaks, the contrast has rekindled discussion about whether you need to be pale to get ahead in Brazil. \nJarid Arraes, a psychology student and blogger, wrote a post criticizing the latent discrimination in media and marketing that she felt Anitta\u2019s image change represented. \u201cPeople refuse to accept that they are racist and they think they live in a multiracial democracy, but the statistics show that is far from the case. The whitening shows us a profoundly intolerant society that doesn\u2019t support diversity. White is the image of the rich, the nice, the successful, the good, while people see black as the opposite of all that.\u201d \nBorn Larissa de Macedo Machado, the diva-to-be was a church chorister in her childhood. In her teens, she made a name for herself in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s baile funk scene as a dancer and singer. \nShe has now exploded into the public consciousness with an album and a huge hit single, Show das Poderosas , which topped the charts and attracted 52 million YouTube views. \nThough adored first and foremost as a pop idol with a strong message and some catchy tunes, her backers project her as a cultural bridge between the predominantly black and mixed-race shanty towns on Rio\u2019s hillsides and the wealthier and whiter communities below. \nShe has toned down the suggestive dancing, gangsta references and explicit lyrics of baile funk. Now, however, questions are being asked about whether she \u2013 or her marketing team \u2013 have gone too far in re-tailoring her image to attract a more lucrative demographic. \u201cIf pop stars have curly hair, they are going to feel coerced into straightening it. If they have a big nose, they will be coerced into getting rhinoplasty,\u201d said Arraes. \u201cIt creates a vicious cycle for self-esteem.\u201d \nThis is a sensitive topic in this largely mixed-raced nation. Brazil \u2013 one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery \u2013 has the largest population of African descent outside Africa, but race and ancestry are less important here than colour. And, despite the nation\u2019s goal of being a multiracial democracy, there is a clear link between skin tone and inequality. \nIn Brazilian cities, white workers earn roughly twice as much as those of African descent. Up until 2011, black or mixed-race students also spent two years less at school on average. \nThe government says the gap is closing thanks to quota systems for university places and other forms of affirmative action. But the gulf remains glaringly apparent. The vast majority of business and government executives are white, while most menial jobs are done by black and mixed-race workers. Walk through Ipanema, G\u00e1vea or other upmarket districts and you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white toddlers than a white nanny pushing a black child. \nDefining colour is complex. People who define themselves as white were in the minority for the first time in the most recent census in 2010. Among the 197 million population, 82 million said they were \u201cpardu\u201d (mixed race), 15 million black, two million Asian and 0.5% indigenous. \nSylvio Ferreira, a psychology lecturer at the Federal University of Pernambuco, believes Anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it tamer and more palatable to everyone. \n\u201cWas this achieved by racial whitening? No,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happened was a change of the social space where Anitta produced her art: from the periphery to the centre.\u201d \nOthers agree that the issue of colour is overblown. Maycon de Mattos Batista, a financial analyst who worked with Anitta while she was an intern, said there had been a huge change in Anitta\u2019s image, but not of her colour. \n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s whitening; it\u2019s more the way they are producing her with makeup, hairstylists and the way she dresses,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was because of pressure being put on her. She always liked to show off, sing and dance. That was a natural thing for her. I believe that it is because of this naturalness that she is where she is today.\u201d \nLeandro Silva de Souza, a racial equality activist in the north-eastern city of Salvador, said the prejudice lay not with society but with music producers and media executives. The public, he said, proved they were interested in music for its own sake by choosing Ellen Ol\u00e9ria \u2013 a black lesbian \u2013 as the recent winner of the talent show The Voice Brazil . \nThe Guardian was unable to reach Anitta for comment. But, in a recent interview, she described the need for identity to be self-defined. \n\u201cAll-powerful is a woman who doesn\u2019t need to be beautiful, but she has so much attitude that she is marvellous, she is powerful. What I try to pass on in my work for everyone is that we can be who we want.\u201d"}
