{"id": "C2-1385", "contents": "The orbital parameters of dark matter (DM) subhaloes play an essential role in determining\ntheir mass-loss rates and overall spatial distribution within a host halo. Haloes in cosmological\nsimulations grow by a combination of relatively smooth accretion and more violent mergers,\nand both processes will modify subhalo orbits. To isolate the impact of the smooth growth of the\nhost halo from other relevant mechanisms, we study subhalo orbital evolution using numerical\ncalculations in which subhaloes are modelled as massless particles orbiting in a time-varying\nspherical potential. We find that the radial action of the subhalo orbit decreases over the first\nfew orbits, indicating that the response to the growth of the host halo is not adiabatic during this\nphase. The subhalo orbits can shrink by a factor of \u223c1.5 in this phase. Subsequently, the radial\naction is well conserved and orbital contraction slows down. We propose a model accurately\ndescribing the orbital evolution. Given these results, we consider the spatial distribution of the\npopulation of subhaloes identified in high-resolution cosmological simulations. We find that it\nis consistent with this population having been accreted at \ud835\udc67 <\n\u223c\n3, indicating that any subhaloes\naccreted earlier are unresolved in the simulations. We also discuss tidal stripping as a formation\nscenario for NGC1052-DF2, an ultra diffuse galaxy significantly lacking DM, and find that\nits expected DM mass could be consistent with observational constraints if its progenitor was\naccreted early enough, \ud835\udc67 >\n\u223c\n1.5, although it should still be a relatively rare object.\nKey words: galaxies: haloes \u2013 galaxies: kinematics and dynamics \u2013 cosmology: dark matter\n\u2013 methods: numerical\n1 INTRODUCTION\nIn the standard paradigm for structure formation in the Universe, the\n\u039b cold dark matter (\u039bCDM) cosmological model, small dark matter\n(DM) haloes form early on through gravitational collapse, and then\nmerge to form larger structures subsequently. At the same time,\nbaryonic gas cools within haloes over some mass scale, igniting\ngalaxy formation. As a result, the hierarchy of observed galaxies\nis formed (e.g., White & Rees 1978; Frenk & White 2012), i.e.,\nsmaller DM subhaloes and associated satellite galaxies, orbiting\nwithin larger host systems consisting of a host DM halo and a\ncentral galaxy. In this paper, we consider the orbital evolution of\nsubhaloes in their host halo, given the mass assembly history of the\nlatter.\nThe orbital parameters of subhaloes are essential in determining their spatial distribution and mass-loss rates, and thus they are\nan important input to observational tests of the nature of DM. For\ninstance, in a structure formation scenario based on an alternative\nDM model, warm dark matter (WDM), the primordial density fluctuations on small scales are smoothed out by the free-streaming\nmotion of WDM particles, and fewer subhaloes are formed, while\nthe minimum halo mass is greater than in the \u039bCDM cosmology\n(Bode et al. 2001; Angulo et al. 2013; Lovell et al. 2014; Bose et al.\n2016, and references therein). This should affect both the abundance\nand the spatial distribution of subhaloes, since the formation of the\nearliest, densest structures would be suppressed. Tests of DM based\non observations of gravitational lensing (e.g., Dalal & Kochanek\n2002; Vegetti et al. 2012; Shu et al. 2015; Hezaveh et al. 2016),\ngaps in stellar streams (e.g., Carlberg 2012; Ngan & Carlberg 2014;\nErkal et al. 2016; Ibata et al. 2020), and annihilation or decay signals\nof DM particles (e.g., Strigari et al. 2007; Pieri et al. 2008; Hayashi\net al. 2016; Hiroshima et al. 2018; Okoli et al. 2018) also depend\nstrongly on the expected abundance, spatial distribution and mass\nfunction of DM subhaloes."}
