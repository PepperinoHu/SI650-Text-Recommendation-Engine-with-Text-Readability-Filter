As you know, it is the biggest technology conference in the country and very important to our work.\nI learned a lot and I've made some new contacts that will be good for our company. I think we should try to attend the 'Innovation Day' in April as well.\nI focused on talks about robotics, as that is our most interesting area at the moment. The presentations on robot 'hands' and robots for hospitals were particularly interesting for us. I'm attaching a detailed report on this new research with some suggestions about how we can use it.\nThanks again for this opportunity. I'm happy to discuss the report further if you're interested.\nBest regards,\nNina"}
