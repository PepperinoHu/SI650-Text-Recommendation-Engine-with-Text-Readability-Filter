{"id": "C1-782", "contents": "\ufeffA degree in Spanish got me my \ufb01rst job as a journalist, with an international press agency in Mexico City, but it didn\u2019t prevent me blundering badly as a rookie reporter. \nI had just arrived in the Mexican capital after a Greyhound bus journey all the way from New York and the job interview was a test of my language skills. In my new role, day shifts were spent on the streets in political rallies and nights were spent alone in the of\ufb01ce, coordinating the coverage from strife- torn El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and the rest of Central America. But, I also had to report on occasional disasters: \ufb01res, \ufb02oods and explosions at \ufb01 rework factories. \nIt was as a reporter that I soon found out that I was as bad at understanding numbers in Spanish as I was at calculating them in English. Phone calls meant for the police got Mexican grandmothers out of bed at 2am because I had misunderstood a number and dialled a dodgy digit. Even worse, victims were piled too high in my stories \u2013 almost 83 dead in a \ufb01 re at 6pm turned out to be as few as 38 by 7pm; 12 people injured in a coach crash soon became two and so it went on. Finally, I got a call from the main of\ufb01ce in Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t know what training you have had,\u201d an editor yelled, \u201cbut has no one ever told you a death toll can\u2019t go down?!\u201d \nWhy are numbers in another language such a conundrum? It may have to do with different numbering systems. If we consider that, in German, for example, which belongs to the same Indo-European language family as English, 2.30pm becomes halb drei (half of three) and 21 becomes einundzwanzig (one and twenty), clearly different numeral systems can cause confusion and that\u2019s without even considering indigenous languages with numeral systems so rare they are in danger of dying out. \nSome experts believe there is a link between dyscalculia \u2013 the dif\ufb01culty in comprehending arithmetic \u2013 and problems learning foreign languages, particularly if languages are learnt by rote, since this involves the sequential processes that students with dyscalculia struggle with. But, some students who struggle to learn languages with a grammar textbook may thrive in a foreign-language setting, where learning is more natural and less reliant on sequences of adjectives, prepositions and so on. In my case, I have always found languages easy enough, apart from the numbers. \nBut, perhaps it\u2019s also because numbers in a non-native language are often heard out of context or in isolation, when the listener might have switched off from the foreign language and be unable to suddenly tune in. A straw poll of multilingual friends found that many can be \ufb02orid in French or Italian when ordering from a restaurant menu, for example, but freeze if they have to relay numbers, especially over the phone. Numbers seem to be taxing, but no one could really say why. \nIn my case, being numerically challenged in a foreign tongue followed me from Mexico to other countries and from Spanish to German and Portuguese. But, in that \ufb01rst journalism job, getting the numbers wrong didn\u2019t always add up to failure. \nOne night, a Mexican colleague learnt that the American consul in the port city of Veracruz was being held hostage at gunpoint in his of\ufb01ce. With no senior English-speaking reporter in the of\ufb01ce, it was left to me to try to reach the consulate by phone. Having got the number wrong, I was put through to an extension elsewhere in the building and the identity of the person who took my call was unmistakable: I chatted for 15 minutes to the gunman. I may not have persuaded him to put away his gun \u2013 but my reputation as a rookie reporter still rose overnight."}
