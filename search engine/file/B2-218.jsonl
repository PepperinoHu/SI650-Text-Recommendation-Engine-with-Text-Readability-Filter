{"id": "B2-218", "contents": "\ufeffThe Canadian tennis player Frank Dancevic slammed Australian Open organizers for forcing players to compete in \u201cinhumane\u201d conditions after he collapsed on court as temperatures rose to 41C. \nDancevic, who collapsed during the second set of his first-round match against France\u2019s Beno\u00eet Paire on the uncovered court six at Melbourne Park and passed out for a minute, said conditions were plainly dangerous for the players. He also said the heat had caused him to hallucinate: \u201cI was dizzy from the middle of the first set and then I saw Snoopy and I thought, 'Wow, Snoopy \u2013 that\u2019s weird.'\u201d \n\u201cI think it\u2019s inhumane. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to anybody \u2013 to the players, to the fans, to the sport \u2013 when you see players pulling out of matches, passing out,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve played five-set matches all my life and being out there for a set and a half and passing out with heat stroke, it\u2019s not normal. \n\u201cHaving players with so many problems and complaining to the tournament that it\u2019s too hot to play; until somebody dies, they just keep going on with it and putting matches on in this heat. I, personally, don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair and I know a lot of players don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair.\u201d \nOther players were in broad agreement. The British number one, Andy Murray, said: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something that you have to look at a little bit. As much as it\u2019s easy to say the conditions are safe, it only takes one bad thing to happen. And it looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing, ball kids are collapsing, people in the stands are collapsing. That\u2019s not great. \n\u201cI know when I went out to hit before the match, the conditions at 2.30\u20133pm were very, very tough. Whether it\u2019s safe or not, I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s been some issues in other sports with players having heart attacks.\u201d \nCaroline Wozniacki said: \u201cI put the water bottle down on the court and it started melting a little bit underneath the plastic. So, you know it was warm.\u201d \nJohn Isner, who retired from his first-round match with a right ankle injury, said: \u201cIt was like an oven when I open the oven and the potatoes are done. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like.\u201d \nThe defending champion Victoria Azarenka took the same line. \u201cIt felt pretty hot, like you\u2019re dancing in a frying pan or something like that,\u201d she said. \nThe tournament\u2019s \u201cextreme heat\u201d contingency plan was put into force for women\u2019s matches on Tuesday, allowing an extra ten-minute break between the second and third sets. Under a change to the rules for 2014, however, the decision on whether to stop matches at the tournament is now at the discretion of the tournament director, Wayne McKewen. Rather than use the raw Celsius readings to assess the heat, organizers prefer to use the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature composite, which also gauges humidity and wind to identify the perceived conditions. Organizers said temperatures peaked at 42.2C in the early evening on Tuesday and conditions had never reached the point where play would be stopped. \u201cWe have to reach a minimum threshold and have a forecast that it will be sustained for a reasonable time,\u201d McKewen said in a statement. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen. While conditions were hot and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured play would continue.\u201d \nDancevic, who said he had felt dizzy from the middle of the second set, resumed after medical attention but, unsurprisingly, ended up losing 7\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20134. \u201cI was really close to stopping completely,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really running too much towards the end. I wasn\u2019t tired; I just felt my body temperature was too high.\u201d \nA ball boy had earlier required medical attention after collapsing during Milos Raonic\u2019s 7\u20136, 6\u20131, 4\u20136, 6\u20132 victory over Daniel Gimeno-Traver on the equally exposed court eight and the tournament shortened rotations for the ball boys to 45-minute shifts. China\u2019s Peng Shuai also said the heat had caused her to cramp up and vomit, and she had to be helped from the court after her 7\u20135, 4\u20136, 6\u20133 defeat to Japan\u2019s Kurumi Nara. Officials played down health risks, saying the majority of matches were completed without calls for medical attention. \n\u201cOf course, there were a few players who experienced heat-related illness or discomfort, but none required significant medical intervention after they had completed their match,\u201d Tim Wood, the tournament\u2019s chief medical officer, said in a statement. \nMost competitors, though, followed Roger Federer\u2019s line that, although conditions were tough, they were the same for both players. \u201cIt\u2019s just a mental thing,\u201d the Swiss said, albeit before Dancevic collapsed. \u201cIf you\u2019ve trained hard enough your entire life, or the last few weeks, and you believe you can do it and come through it, there\u2019s no reason. If you can\u2019t deal with it, you throw in the towel.\u201d \nDancevic disagreed. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s much to do with the shape the players are in. Some players are used to the heat \u2013 their bodies can genetically handle the heat and others\u2019 can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hazardous to be out there; it\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s an hour and a half since my match and I still can\u2019t pee.\u201d"}
