The late fee is $5.\nOkay, I'm only one minute late.\nOne minute late, one month late, one year late, it doesn't matter.\nAre you kidding me? There's a big difference between one minute and one month.\nLook, the point is - they're late.\nScrew you! I ain't payin $5.\nI guess you'll never borrow another book, magazine, or video here ever again.\nIt's okay, because I don't even like this library.\nThis library doesn't like you either!\nI am leaving! You are plain rude.\nLeave! Nobody wants to see you."}
