On behalf of the company I would like to apologise for the length of time it took for you to receive your final quote for this renewal. I am also sorry for the inconvenience caused when the discounts you received were not automatically applied.\nWe have taken your suggestions on board and will review our renewals process for existing customers. We understand your point that the process should not take as long for existing customers as for new customers buying a new policy.\nIn appreciation of the many years you have been a customer of Top Car Insurance we are happy to refund you the difference in price between your new and your previous premium, i.e. \u00a373.20. I have also made a note on your account to ensure that your next renewals process will run more smoothly for you.\nWe value your feedback and will use it to improve our service.\nWe trust that you will find this a satisfactory response to your complaint and that this correspondence will bring this matter to a close.
