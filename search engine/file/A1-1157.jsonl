Paris is a very old and interesting city. There are lots of beautiful old buildings to visit. I am staying with a French family. They are very nice and I feel very welcome\nin their house. I usually have dinner with the family in the evening. They don\u2019t speak English so I can practice my French. The other students in my class are friendly. They are from all\naround the world. At the weekend we are planning to go out together to watch a film.\nSee you soon,\nMark"}
