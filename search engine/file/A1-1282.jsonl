I left it at home.\nI can't take your word for it.\nWhy not? I'm an A+ student.\nHow do I know if you even did the homework?\nI'll ask my mom to take a picture of it and send it to me.\nThat's fair enough.\nThanks. Also, you should try trusting students more. We're not all that bad.\nI'll try, but I can't promise anything."}
