D\u00f6gg, Dimmbl\u00e1, Etna and Eybj\u00f6rt are fine; likewise Frigg, Gl\u00f3d\u00eds, H\u00f6rn and Ingunn. J\u00f3rlaug works OK, as do Obba, Sigurflj\u00f3\u00f0, \u00daran\u00eda and \u2013 should you choose \u2013 Vagna. But you cannot, as a girl in Iceland, be called Harriet. \n\u201cThe whole situation,\u201d said Tristan Cardew, with very British understatement, \u201cis really rather silly.\u201d With his Icelandic wife, Kristin, Cardew is appealing against a decision by the National Registry in the capital Reykjavik not to renew their ten-year-old daughter Harriet\u2019s passport on the grounds that it does not recognize her first name. \nSince the registry does not recognize the name of Harriet\u2019s 12-year-old brother, Duncan, either, the two children have, until now, travelled on passports identifying them as St\u00falka and Drengur Cardew: Girl and Boy Cardew. \u201cBut, this time, the authorities have decided to apply the letter of the law,\u201d Cardew, a British-born cook who moved to Iceland in 2000, said. \u201cAnd that says no official document will be issued to people who do not bear an approved Icelandic name.\u201d \nThe impasse meant the family, from K\u00f3pavogur, risked missing their holiday in France until they applied to the British embassy for an emergency UK passport, which should now allow them to leave. \nNames matter in Iceland, a country of barely 320,000 people, whose phone book lists subscribers by their first name for the very sensible reason that the vast majority of Icelandic surnames simply record the fact that you are your father\u2019s (or mother\u2019s) son or daughter. J\u00f3n Einarsson\u2019s offspring, for example, might be \u00d3lafur J\u00f3nsson and Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir. \nThe law dictates that the names of children born in Iceland must \u2013 unless both parents are foreign \u2013 be submitted to the National Registry within six months of birth. If they are not on a recognized list of 1,853 female and 1,712 male names, the parents must seek the approval of a body called the Icelandic Naming Committee. \nFor the 5,000 or so children born in Iceland each year, the committee reportedly receives about 100 applications and rejects about half under a 1996 act aimed mainly at preserving the language of the sagas. Among its requirements are that given names must be \u201ccapable of having Icelandic grammatical endings\u201d, may not \u201cconflict with the linguistic structure of Iceland\u201d and should be \u201cwritten in accordance with the ordinary rules of Icelandic orthography\u201d. \nWhat this means in practice is that names containing letters that do not officially exist in Iceland\u2019s 32-letter alphabet, such as \u201cc \u201d, are out. Similarly, names unable to accommodate the endings required by the nominative, accusative, genitive and dative cases used in Icelandic are also routinely turned down. \u201cThat was the problem with Harriet,\u201d said Cardew. \nThe country\u2019s naming laws have come under increasing fire in recent years: in 2013, Bl\u00e6r \u2013 \u201cLight Breeze\u201d \u2013 Bjarkard\u00f3ttir R\u00fanarsdottir won the right to be officially known by her given name, as opposed to \u201cGirl\u201d, when a court ruled that denying her was a violation of the Icelandic constitution. The former mayor of Reykjavik, J\u00f3n Gnarr, has also called Iceland\u2019s naming law \u201cunfair, stupid and against creativity\u201d. \nThe Cardews could get round Harriet\u2019s problem by giving her an Icelandic middle name. \u201cBut it\u2019s a bit late for that and way too silly,\u201d said Cardew. \u201cAre they saying they don\u2019t want us here?\u201d"}
