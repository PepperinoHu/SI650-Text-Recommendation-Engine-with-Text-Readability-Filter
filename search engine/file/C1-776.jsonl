Not one was unaffected by some form of noise from human activity, be it over-flying aircraft, motorbikes, motorboats or tour buses. \nFristrup\u2019s team combined the sound levels recorded from national parks with similar data from urban settings to create a model of noise levels across the US. They predict that noise pollution is growing faster than the US population and more than doubles every 30 years. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising people are putting on earphones or even noise cancelling headphones to try and create a quieter or more congenial environment,\u201d he said. \n\u201cAs you raise background sound levels, it has the same effect on your hearing that fog would have on your vision. Instead of having this expansive experience of all the sounds around you, you are aware of only a small area around you,\u201d he said. \u201cEven in most of our cities, there are birds and things to appreciate in the environment, and there can be very rich natural choruses to pay attention to. And that is being lost.\u201d \nPeople quickly become accustomed to changes in their environments, including rising noise levels, and, over time, Fristrup fears that we will accept far worse environmental conditions than we should and forget how much quieter the world could be. \u201cIf finding peace and quiet becomes difficult enough, many, many children will grow up without the experience and I think it\u2019s a very real problem,\u201d he said. \nThe warning came as other scientists reported beneficial health effects from listening to natural sounds. Speaking at the same meeting, Derrick Taff, a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University, described preliminary experiments which suggest that listening to recordings from national parks, of waterfalls, birdsong and wind, helped people recover from stressful events. \nIn one experiment, Taff told participants who visited his lab to give an impromptu talk that would be judged by researchers standing behind a one-way mirror. Measurements of their heart rate and the stress hormone, cortisol, before and after the speech found that people calmed down faster when they listened to nature recordings than when the same audio tracks were interspersed with sounds from road traffic, aeroplanes and even normal conversation. \n\u201cWe know that natural sounds are very important to people. They are some of the main reasons people visit protected areas. They want to hear the natural quiet, the birdsong, and the wind and water,\u201d Taff said. \u201cWe may be losing this as people are listening to iPods all the time but I do believe that the public is appreciative of these sounds. My advice is to go to your protected areas and experience what you are missing.\u201d \nWhy natural sounds might be calming to people is unclear but Fristrup speculates that, over millions of years of evolution, we may have come to associate the more tranquil sounds of the natural world with safety. \u201cI suspect there\u2019s something about these intact soundscapes that reminds our ancestral brains of a place that\u2019s safe, where there\u2019s no sense of a predator nearby, and that these more cluttered soundscapes are problematic for us because we know we\u2019ve lost that surveillance capability,\u201d he said."}
