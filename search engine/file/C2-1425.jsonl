{"id": "C2-1425", "contents": "His Edinburgh and Cambridge mentors were to shape Darwin\u2019s philosophical attitudes and scientific career decisively. It was Henslow who was the final link to Darwin in a chain connected to Captain Robert Fitzroy of H. M. S. Beagle. Fitzroy sought a gentleman companion who could also collect information on geology and natural history during a proposed circumnavigation of the globe. Henslow\u2019s note to Darwin, asking if he would be interested in being recommended for this post, arrived at the Darwin home, \u2018the Mount\u2019, while Charles Darwin was on a geological survey of Northern Wales with Adam Sedgwick. After resistance from his father had been overcome, Darwin was offered the post and accepted it.\nThe combination of meticulous field observation, collection and experimentation, note taking, reading and thinking during what turned into the Beagle\u2019s five year journey through a very wide cross-section of the earth\u2019s environments was to set the course for the rest of his life. During the voyage he read and reread Charles Lyell\u2019s newly published Principles of Geology, a three-volume work that articulated a philosophical vision of rigorously empirical historical science, oriented around five key ideas:\nThe geologist investigates both the animate and inanimate changes that have taken place during the earth\u2019s history.\nHis principal tasks are to develop an accurate and comprehensive record of those changes, to encapsulate that knowledge in general laws, and to search for their causes.\nThis search must be limited to causes that can be studied empirically\u2014those \u2018now in operation\u2019, as Lyell puts it in the sub-title of his Principles.\nThe records or \u2018monuments\u2019 of the earth\u2019s past indicate a constant process of the \u2018introduction\u2019 and \u2018extinction\u2019 of species, and it is the geologist\u2019s task to search for the causes of these introductions and extinctions, according to the strictures note in 3., above.\nThe only serious attempt to do so according to the idea that species are capable of \u2018indefinite modification\u2019, that of Jean Baptiste Lamarck, is a failure on methodological grounds. All the evidence supports the view that species variability is limited, and that one species cannot be transformed into another.\nThis vision influenced Darwin profoundly, as he freely admitted. While he became convinced by his observations and reading that the fossil record and current distribution of species could only be due to the gradual transformation of one species into another, he was determined to articulate a theory that measured up to Lyell\u2019s principles. The crucial event in convincing him that this was to be his life\u2019s work was likely a visit to Cape Town, South Africa during the Beagle\u2019s return trip to England. John F. W. Herschel was in Cape Town on a mission to do for the Southern Hemisphere what his father William had done for the Northern, namely to develop a comprehensive star map with the new powerful telescopes developed by his father and aunt. As noted earlier, Darwin had been deeply impressed by Herschel\u2019s Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy when it first appeared a year before the Beagle set sail, and in his private journal he referred to his meetings with Herschel during a week long stop in Cape Town in June of 1836 as among the most profound events of the entire voyage. Just five months before meeting Darwin, Herschel had finished reading the 2nd edition of Lyell\u2019s Principles. He sent Lyell a long letter filled with detailed constructive commentary. The letter opens by praising Lyell for facing the issue of the \u2018introduction of new species\u2019\u2014which Herschel calls \u2018that mystery of mysteries\u2019\u2014scientifically, and for advocating that we search for \u2018intermediate causes\u2019 to explain these \u2018introductions\u2019\u2014code for natural, as opposed to \u2018miraculous\u2019, causes.[5] This part of the letter was quoted in Charles Babbage\u2019s Bridgewater Treatise, published in 1837 while Darwin was struggling to develop just such a theory. Upon reading the Herschel quotation in Babbage, Darwin wrote in his private \u2018species\u2019 notebooks:\nBabbage 2d Edit, p. 226.\u2014Herschel calls the appearance of new species. the mystery of mysteries. & has grand passage upon problem.! Hurrah.\u2014\u201cintermediate causes\u201d. (Barrett et al., 1987, 413; original punctuation)\nHe clearly recognizes that Herschel is here providing a philosophical justification for the project upon which Darwin was secretly working. And, in the very first paragraph of On the Origin of Species, Darwin looks back to this \u2018Hurrah\u2019, attributing the idea that the origin of species is \u2018that mystery of mysteries\u2019 to \u2018one of our greatest philosophers\u2019, without mentioning Herschel by name. The first mention of the possibility of an evolutionary solution to this problem is in his Ornithological Notebooks, in a note written shortly after departing Cape Town."}
