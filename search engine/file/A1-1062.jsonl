Why do you say that?\nYou're old enough to cook dinner.\nAre you saying it's my turn now?\nActually, that's exactly what I'm saying.\nWhat would you like to eat, then?\nI'm craving some spaghetti, bread, and even a salad.\nFrozen pizza it is, then!\nYou are so lazy! Can you even cook?\nOf course I can cook! I choose not to.\nYou're having hot pockets for dinner tomorrow."}
