She prefers to read. She reads in the morning, in the afternoon and at night.\nI give all of the vegetables to mom and dad. They like to cook in our small kitchen. I eat any vegetable but my sister eats only a few.\nMy family always eats breakfast and dinner together. We talk. We laugh. Then my sister washes the dishes.\nAt night dad likes to listen to music. Mom works on the computer. I watch television. And my sister reads.\nSoon we go to bed. My parents go to bed late but my sister and I go to bed early. I\u2019m ready to go to sleep but my sister wants to keep reading."}
