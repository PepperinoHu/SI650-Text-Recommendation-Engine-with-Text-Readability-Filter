I had a great time at your house. Thank you for making me feel at home. I'm sure my English improved a lot because of all your help too! Also, thank you for all the wonderful cooking you did. Now I can tell everyone English food is not as bad as they say .\nIf you ever come to Sri Lanka, I hope you will stay with me and I can show you my city too.\nKeep in touch!.\nPradeep"}
