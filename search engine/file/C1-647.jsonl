When she jumped out of bed she could see a huge vapour trail hanging in the morning sky and hear the wail of car alarms from the street below. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what was going on,\u201d said Zaglumyonova. \u201cThere was a big explosion and then a series of little explosions. My first thought was that it was a plane crash.\u201d \nWhat she had actually witnessed were the death throes of a ten-tonne meteorite that plunged to Earth in a series of fireballs just after sunrise. Officials put the number of people injured at almost 1,200, with more than 40 taken to hospital \u2013 most as a result of flying glass shattered by the sonic boom created by the meteorite\u2019s descent. There were no reported deaths. \nThe meteorite entered the atmosphere travelling at a speed of at least 33,000mph and broke up into chunks between 18 and 32 miles above the ground, according to a statement from the Russian Academy of Sciences. \nThe event caused panic in Chelyabinsk, a city of more than one million people to the south of Russia\u2019s Ural mountains, as mobile phone networks swiftly became jammed by the volume of calls. Amateur video footage from the area, often peppered with the obscene language of frightened observers, showed the chunks of meteorite glowing more brightly as they approached the moment of impact. \nThe vapour trail was visible for hundreds of miles around, including in neighbouring Kazakhstan. Tatyana Bets was at work in the reception area of a hospital clinic in the centre of the city when the meteorite struck. \u201cFirst we noticed the wind, and then the room was filled with a very bright light and we could see a cloud of some unspecified smoke in the sky,\u201d she said. Then, after a few minutes, came the explosions. At least three craters were subsequently discovered, according to the Ministry of the Interior, and were being monitored by the military. One crater was more than six metres wide, while another lump of meteorite was reported to have slammed through the thick ice of a nearby lake. Radiation levels at the impact sites were normal, according to local military officials. \nIn Chelyabinsk itself, schools and universities were closed and many other staff told to go home early. About 200 children were among the injured. \nA steady stream of lightly injured people, most suffering cuts from flying glass, came into the clinic where Bets works. She said a nearby dormitory building for college students was particularly badly affected and many of the students were brought in suffering from fright. \u201cThere were a lot of girls in shock. Some were very pale and many of them fainted,\u201d she said. \nEarly estimates suggested more than 100,000 square metres of glass had been broken and 3,000 buildings hit. The total cost of the damage in the city was being valued at in excess of one billion roubles (\u00a320m). \nThe meteorite over Chelyabinsk arrived less than a day before asteroid 2012 DA14 was expected to make the closest pass to Earth (about 17,510 miles) of any recorded cosmic body. But experts said the two events were linked by nothing more than coincidence. \nRumours and conspiracy theories, however, swirled in the first few hours after the incident. Reports on Russian state television and in local media suggested that the meteorite was engaged by local air defence units and blown apart at an altitude of more than 15 miles. \nThe ultranationalist leader of Russia\u2019s Liberal Democrat party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, said it was not a meteorite but military action by the United States, echoing much of the speculation voiced on amateur film footage. \u201cIt\u2019s not a meteorite falling \u2013 it\u2019s a test of new American weapons,\u201d Zhirinovsky said. \nSome were quick to take advantage of the confusion. Enterprising people were offering lumps of meteorite for sale through internet sites within a few hours of the impact. \nPresident Vladimir Putin and the Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, were informed about the incident, and Putin convened a meeting with the head of the Emergency Situations Ministry. \u201cIt\u2019s proof that not only are economies vulnerable but the whole planet,\u201d Medvedev said at an economic forum in Siberia. \nDmitry Rogozin, Russia\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister and former Ambassador to NATO, took to Twitter to call for an international push to create a warning system for all \u201cobjects of an alien origin\u201d. Neither the US nor Russia had the capability to bring down such objects, he added."}
