Hot-water boilers and cooking facilities release heat into their immediate surroundings. In hot countries, warm air comes in through doors and windows. Then, there is visible light and infrared radiation from the sun, which also heat up buildings. \nThe Stanford mirror was designed in such a way that it reflects 97% of the visible light that falls on it. But, more importantly, it works as a thermal radiator. When the mirror is warmed up, it releases heat at a specific wavelength of infrared light that passes easily through the atmosphere and out into space. \nTo make anything cool requires what engineers call a heat sink: somewhere to dump unwanted heat. The heat sink has to be cooler than the object that needs cooling or it will not do its job. For example, a bucket of ice will cool a bottle of wine because it becomes a sink for heat in the liquid. The Stanford mirror relies on the ultimate heat sink: the universe itself. \nThe mirror is built from several layers of wafer-thin materials. The first layer is reflective silver. On top of this are alternating layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide. These layers improve the reflectivity but, also, turn the mirror into a thermal radiator. When silicon dioxide heats up, it radiates the heat as infrared light at a wavelength of around ten micrometres. Since there is very little in the atmosphere that absorbs at that wavelength, the heat passes straight out to space. The total thickness of the mirror is around two micrometres or two thousandths of a millimetre. \n\u201cThe cold darkness of the universe can be used as a renewable thermodynamic resource, even during the hottest hours of the day,\u201d the scientists write in Nature. In tests, the mirror had a cooling power of 40 watts per square metre at ambient temperature. \nWriting in the journal, Fan puts the installed cost of mirrors at between $20 and $70 per square metre and calculates an annual electricity saving of 100MWh on a three-storey building. \nFan said that the mirror could cool buildings \u2013 or other objects \u2013 simply by putting it in direct contact with them. Coating the roof of a building with the mirror would prevent heating from sunlight but do little to remove heat from its interior. More likely, the mirror would be used to cool water or some other fluid that would then be pumped around the building. \nHe ruled out the idea of using the mirrors to slow down global warming. \u201cRoof space accounts for only a small portion of the Earth\u2019s surface so, at this point, we don\u2019t think this would be a geoengineering solution. Rather, our contribution on the greenhouse-gas-emission issue is simply to reduce electricity consumption,\u201d he said. \n\u201cI\u2019m really excited by the potential it has and the applications for cooling,\u201d said Marin Solja\u010di\u0107, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou could use this on buildings so you have to spend much less on air conditioning or maybe you wouldn\u2019t need it at all. You could put it on top of shopping malls. With a large enough surface, you could get substantial cooling.\u201d"}
