But that\u2019s exactly what Kiruna, an Arctic town in northern Sweden, is having to do \u2013 to avoid being swallowed up into the earth. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a dystopian choice,\u201d says Krister Lindstedt of White, the Stockholm-based architects firm charged with the biblical task of moving this city of 23,000 people away from a gigantic iron-ore mine that is fast gobbling up the ground beneath its streets. \u201cEither the mine must stop digging, creating mass unemployment, or the city has to move \u2013 or else face certain destruction. It\u2019s an existential predicament.\u201d \nFounded in 1900 by the state-owned Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara mining company (LK), Kiruna has grown rich off the vast seam of iron ore below the town, but it\u2019s now facing destruction by the very phenomenon that created its wealth. \u201cWe are symbiotic: the town is here because of the mine,\u201d says Deputy Mayor Niklas Siren. \u201cOtherwise, no devil would have built a city here.\u201d \nLocated 145km inside the Arctic Circle, Kiruna is subject to a brutal climate, enduring winters with no sunlight and average temperatures below -15C. But the deep deposit of magnetite has proved a strong enough magnet to keep people here. Driven by the insatiable global appetite for construction, the mine has become the world\u2019s largest underground iron-ore extraction site, producing 90% of all the iron in Europe, enough to build more than six Eiffel Towers a day. And demand continues to grow. \nIn 2004, the mining company broke it to the town that its days were numbered: digging its shafts towards the city at an angle of 60 degrees, subsidence would soon lead to the widespread cracking and collapse of the town\u2019s buildings. A decade on, fissures are starting to appear in the ground, creeping ever closer to the town. \n\u201cThe people of Kiruna have been living in limbo for ten years,\u201d says Viktoria Walldin, a social anthropologist who works with the architects. \u201cThey have put their lives on hold, unable to make major decisions like buying a house, redecorating, having a child or opening a business.\u201d \nAfter years of dithering, the city has finally unveiled a master plan for how it will proceed. \u201cImagine it like a walking millipede of a city,\u201d says Lindstedt, unrolling a plan that shows the town\u2019s streets and squares beginning to crawl eastwards along a new high street, until the whole place has moved safely out of the way of the mine by 2033. \nA new town square is already under way, 3km to the east, with a circular town hall planned by Danish architect Henning Larsen, while 20 key buildings have been identified to be dismantled and resurrected piece by piece in their new home \u2013 like an Ikea flatpack on a grand scale. Kiruna\u2019s rust-red wooden church, built in 1912 in a form that recalls the indigenous Sami teepees, and once voted Sweden\u2019s most beautiful building, will take pride of place in a new park, while the cast- iron bell tower will stand once again above the town hall. But not everything will be saved. \n\u201cI spoke to an old lady who walks past the bench every day where she had her first kiss,\u201d says Walldin. \u201cIt\u2019s things like that \u2013 the hospital where your first child was born, for example \u2013 that are important to people\u2019s sense of identity and all that\u2019s going to disappear.\u201d \nBilled as \u201cthe most democratic move in history \u201d, the project has been allocated the equivalent of \u00a3320m by the mining company for building new facilities, including a high school, fire station, community centre, library and swimming hall. But top of most people\u2019s concerns is where they will actually live and what process will determine the housing allocation. \n\u201cThese details have yet to be determined,\u201d admits Lindstedt. \u201cPeople are used to very low rents and very high incomes but, in future, this will have to change.\u201d LK has agreed to compensate residents to the value of their homes plus 25% but many locals say this is not enough to afford a new-build house at market rates. \nTo aid the valuation process, the architects have monitored the housing lettings in nearby cities over a period of years, and \u201ctagged\u201d the homes in Kiruna with the assets they possess, from internal space and gardens to proximity to bus stops and the city centre. They have also proposed a \u201cKiruna Portal \u201d, a kind of mass salvage yard, where materials from the doomed homes can be brought and hopefully recycled in the construction of the new buildings \u2013 although, given that Sweden has no tradition of self-build, it\u2019s hard to see this taking off. \nA closer look at the plan shows the new town bears little relation to the original Kiruna at all. The current town is a sprawling suburban network of winding streets, home to detached houses with gardens. White\u2019s plan incorporates a much higher-density arrangement of multi-storey apartment blocks around shared courtyards, lining straight boulevards, down which the icy winds will surge. \nIt is an opportunity, say the architects, for Kiruna to \u201creinvent itself\u201d into a model of sustainable development, attracting young people who wouldn\u2019t have stayed in the town before, with new cultural facilities and \u201cvisionary\u201d things such as a cable car bobbing above the high street. But it is a vision that many of the existing residents seem unlikely to be able to afford."}
