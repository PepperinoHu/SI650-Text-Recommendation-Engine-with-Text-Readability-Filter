It was not an easy task and I'm glad it went well.\nYou were well prepared. The content was relevant and easy to follow. You also thought about the questions people would have. I think they were impressed! I'm sure everyone feels happier about the new system now.\nIf you have time, please could you listen to my presentation for next week?\nSee you later\nSue"}
