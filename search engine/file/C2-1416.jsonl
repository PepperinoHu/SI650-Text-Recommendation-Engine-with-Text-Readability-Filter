{"id": "C2-1416", "contents": "Production of orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) in Tanzania is constrained by the underutilization of\nvirus-free improved certified planting materials. The sustainable use of these planting materials leads to\nthe constant demand of the planting materials by farmers which can be triggered from viable\nprocessing. We determine the viability of processing in the OFSP value chain and its contribution to the\nuptake of high-quality improved planting materials. Data for this study were collected by field survey\nmethod from 15 processors and 150 farmers. Purposive and three-stage random sampling methods\nwere used in sampling. We adopted a mixed method of analysis using descriptive statistics, gross\nmargin analysis, and econometric estimation of the multivariate probit model by means of a Simulated\nMaximum Likelihood (SML). We found no direct effect of processing to trigger the use of improved\nOFSP planting materials unless formalization of the supply arrangements between processors and\nfarmers is institutionalized. However, it was economically viable to engage in the processing of OFSP.\nProcessors were found to be generating a benefit of US$ 76/ton of OFSP processed with a margin to a\ntotal cost ratio of 19% implying a relatively low margin with significant processing costs. Seed renewal\nwas low as 63.1% of the farmers used retained planting materials. Nevertheless, contractual\narrangements with the processors increased the desire to use high-quality improved planting materials\nand the likelihood to source them from research institutes (p<0.05). Additionally, access to credit and a\nhigh level of specialization influenced farmers to source planting materials from local vine multipliers.\nCreation of market linkage and formalization of supply arrangements between processors and farmers\nand awareness creation on the economic benefits of seed renewal will increase the benefits generated\nby processors. This may contribute to the uptake of high-quality improved OFSP planting materials in\nTanzania.\nKey words: Economic viability, orange fleshed sweet potato, processing, value chain, market linkage.\nINTRODUCTION\nSweet potato (Ipomoea batatas Lam) is one of the most\nimportant food crops worldwide. In Africa, the crop is\nused for food and income though its marketing is limited\nby its short shelf life (Rees et al., 2001; Oladoye et al.,\n2016; Flores, 2018). In Tanzania, sweet potato is an\nimportant food security root crop after cassava being\ngrown by 1.08 million smallholder farmers (NBS, 2017).\nWith its annual production of 4.2 million tons per annum,\nTanzania is the leading producer in Africa, and accounts\nfor 3.8% of the world\u2019s sweet potato production (FAO,\n2020).\nThe crop has consistent reliable yields, due to the\nreason that it can be grown on marginal land, and thus\nsuitable for areas with long dry seasons. The crop is\nuseful disaster recovery crop when other crops fail.\nSweet potatoes are also important source of food in the\nhomes of the rural and urban poor and important income\nsource for households in Tanzania. Sweet potato lies\nwithin its adaptability to marginal conditions such as\ndrought, low soil fertility, and thus make it ranked highly\nas food security crop when local staple crops such as\nmaize and rice fail (HKI, 2012; Waziri, 2013).\nTanzania ranks fifth in the world in terms of sweet potato\nproduction (HKI, 2012). Tanzania\u2019s production data for\nsweet potato show that there had been increasing trends\nin the production and area under sweet potato production\nin the country from year 2008 to 2018 (NBS, 2020).\nHowever, there is no disaggregated data that would\nindicate the level of Orange Fleshed Sweet Potatoes\n(OFSP) and the White Fleshed Sweet Potatoes (WFSP)\nproduction. OFSP are rich in beta carotene, a vitamin A\nprecursor for improving the nutrition of people especially\nchildren under five years of age. They have high content\nof carotenoids and pleasant sensory characteristics with\ncolor (Neela and Fanta, 2019)."}
