I heard there is a flu going around.\nWell, I have to be sure to take good care of myself.\nSucks that you aren't feeling well, it's a nice day.\nIt is. The sunshine makes me want to go to the beach.\nThat's a great idea, but I think you'll get sicker if you go.\nTrue. Perhaps we can go some other time?\nFor sure. Let's get together next week and go if you're better.\nSounds like a plan. I'll talk to you later.\nCool, see you later."}
