Enter a department store and you will be watched. But new technology is leading retailers to grow a different set of eyes \u2013 less focused on shoplifting and more interested in your age, sex, size, head, shoulders, knees and toes. \nA few months ago, IT firm Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) produced a report that claimed around 30% of retailers use facial recognition technology to track customers in-store. Facial recognition is a technology that can identify people by analysing and comparing facial features from a database, using devices such as Intel RealSense cameras, which are able to analyse everything from particular expressions to the clothing brands someone is wearing. \nJoe Jensen, of Intel\u2019s Retail Solutions Division, says that the aim of bringing RealSense technology into shops is not to create databases of specific people\u2019s lives but rather to build generalized models of people\u2019s lifestyles and shopping habits. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that you need to know a particular customer. It\u2019s that you need to know that this shopper has these characteristics and, in the past, that when those characteristics are present, this is what a person tends to do.\u201d \nIf you combine recognition technology with databases of previous customer patterns, you can start to predict a lot about what a person may or may not do in a shop. If, say, there\u2019s a size-10 woman wearing a gold necklace walking quickly towards the sock aisle, you can use that data to predict she wants to, well, buy socks. That could allow a retailer to automatically put targeted ads on screens aimed specifically at that person. If she looks like the type of person who wants to buy socks, they will show her adverts for socks. \nIf it sounds familiar, it\u2019s because the online world has been using techniques like these for years. \nIf you search for something on Amazon, you\u2019ll be hounded by targeted banners for similar products on other sites. Express a vague interest in canoeing and you\u2019ll get ads for canoes wherever you go. Yet bringing these systems into the physical world isn\u2019t a simple case of copy and paste. It turns out that people do not react to cameras in the same way as they do to browser cookies. \nHoxton Analytics, a London-based team of data scientists, has developed a technology that makes use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to categorize people based on the shoes they are wearing. By analysing the style and size of people\u2019s footwear as they walk past the sensor, the system can identify a customer\u2019s gender with between 75 and 80% accuracy. \nOwen McCormack, Hoxton Analytics CEO, says that the focus of the system came about in part as a reaction to facial recognition. \u201cMy idea was, why don\u2019t we simply consider the clothes someone\u2019s wearing to understand demographics?\u201d he said. \u201cIf I just showed you a shot of someone\u2019s body you could probably tell me what gender they are. However, it turns out pointing a camera at someone\u2019s chest or hips feels just as creepy as facial recognition. The idea was \u2013 what about people\u2019s shoes?\u201d \nThe word \u201ccreepy\u201d comes up a lot during discussions of in-store tracking. For retailers and data scientists, the aim is to find a way of obtaining information without coming across as intrusive. \nFor Hoxton Analytics and the retailers using the technology, the answer is to look downwards. This tactic of avoiding the face and staring at shoes says a lot about how we, as physical beings, react to being watched. It suggests there are boundaries that do not exist on the internet. Set sights on our torsos and we feel invaded. But is making calculated judgments about a person based on their footwear actually any less invasive? \nFor McCormack, the argument hinges on the fact that personally identifiable information isn\u2019t being collected. \u201cRight now, shops are doing lots of incredibly invasive things but we just don\u2019t know about it. The angle Hoxton Analytics is taking on that whole thing is, well, if you know someone\u2019s a male or a female, then your advertising will be much more efficient. If you know that everyone in your shop right now is a male, you\u2019ll be advertising PlayStations not hairdryers.\u201d \nKeep it hidden and invisible monitoring lets shops optimize their output while keeping the customer unaware. Put adaptable monitors and targeted advertising into the mix, however, and it becomes harder to hide the fact that a machine is watching you. The argument from the retailers is that they do this to provide a personal shopping experience but it remains a grey area. It still feels creepy. \nFrom the perspective of retailers, it\u2019s understandable that physical shops want some of the information online outlets collect. We allow this to happen online so why not offline? The thresholds of a shopping centre are different from those between websites and, when you can wander freely from one place to another without a pop-up asking you to accept cookies, the rules of consent change. \nThen again, for a generation growing up with online first, physical shop second, the modes of online play may not be quite so invasive. In the CSC report, a survey indicated that while 72% of respondents aged 55 and over said they were very uncomfortable with these types of technologies being used in physical shops, only 51% of 16-24 year olds said the same. \nDoes this relative openness stem from a greater familiarity with digital technology or a blind belief in the goodwill of omnipresent organizations offering free services? Is the creepiness of a technology an unvarying, instinctive certainty or does it ebb and flow with degrees of social acceptance? Whatever the case, there are a growing number of eyes between the shelves and they care a lot about what you\u2019re wearing."}
