{"id": "C1-774", "contents": "\ufeffThe bestselling title on Amazon in the US is not Harper Lee\u2019s hugely anticipated second novel, Go Set a Watchman, nor George RR Martin\u2019s Song of Ice and Fire fantasy series, nor even Zoella\u2019s much-mocked but much-bought young adult hit, Girl Online . Instead, Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford is topping the charts with her colouring books for adults, taking top spots on Amazon.com\u2019s bestseller lists. \nBasford\u2019s intricately drawn pictures of flora and fauna in Secret Garden have sold 1.4 million copies worldwide to date, with the newly released follow-up Enchanted Forest selling just under 226,000 copies already. They have drawn fans from Zooey Deschanel, who shared a link about the book with her Facebook followers, to the South Korean pop star Kim Ki-Bum, who posted an image on Instagram for his 1.6 million followers. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been crazy. The last few weeks since Enchanted Forest came out have been utter madness, but fantastic madness,\u201d said Eleanor Blatherwick, head of sales and marketing at the books\u2019 publisher, small British press Laurence King. \u201cWe knew the books would be beautiful but we didn\u2019t realize it would be such a phenomenal success.\u201d \nAnd it is not just Basford who is reaping the benefits of the hordes of adults who, it turns out, just wanted something to colour in. In the UK, Richard Merritt\u2019s Art Therapy Colouring Book sits in fourth spot on Amazon\u2019s bestseller lists, Millie Marotta\u2019s Animal Kingdom \u2013 detailed pictures of animals to colour \u2013 sits in seventh and a mindfulness colouring book sits in ninth. Basford\u2019s titles are in second and eighth place \u2013 that\u2019s half of Amazon.co.uk\u2019s top ten taken up by colouring books for adults. \nAt independent UK publisher Michael O\u2019Mara, which has sold almost 340,000 adult colouring books to date, Head of Publicity, Marketing and Online, Ana McLaughlin, attributes the craze to the way the category has been reimagined as a means of relaxation. \u201cThe first one we did was in 2012, Creative Colouring for Grown-Ups . It sold strongly and reprinted but it was in 2014 that it all really mushroomed with Art Therapy . It really took off for us \u2013 selling the anti-stress angle gave people permission to enjoy something they might have felt was quite childish,\u201d she said. \nThe Mindfulness Colouring Book pushes this perspective particularly strongly, with its publisher telling readers that it is \u201cfilled with templates for exquisite scenes and intricate, sophisticated patterns, prompting you to meditate on your artwork as you mindfully and creatively fill these pages with colour \u201d, and urging potential colourers to \u201ctake a few minutes out of your day, wherever you are, and colour your way to peace and calm \u201d. \n\u201cI think it is really relaxing to do something analogue, to unplug,\u201d said Basford. \u201cAnd it\u2019s creative. For many people, a blank sheet is very daunting; with a colouring book, you just need to bring the colour. Also, there\u2019s a bit of nostalgia there. So many people have said to me that they used to do secret colouring in when their kids were in bed. Now, it is socially acceptable; it\u2019s a category of its own. These are books for adults. The art in my books is super intricate.\u201d \nThe illustrator, who lives in Aberdeenshire, has been astonished at the reaction since she released Secret Garden in 2013. \u201cI had a kids\u2019 book commissioned and I told them I would like to do one for grown-ups. It really wasn\u2019t a trend then. I drew up the first story and they thought, \u2018Let\u2019s go for it\u2019. I was thinking simply that people like me would like to do it. My intention was just to make a book I would like to have. So it\u2019s been a real surprise to see the category bloom.\u201d \nShe is currently working on a third book and Michael O\u2019Mara, which already has 17 adult colouring books in circulation, will increase this to 22 by May, with forthcoming titles including The Classic Comic Colouring Book and The Typography Colouring Book. \u201cIt\u2019s just an enormous trend and shows no signs of slowing down,\u201d said McLaughlin, adding that those who buy the titles are keen to display their ability to stay within the lines to the world at large. \n\u201cThe pictures are all over Twitter and Instagram. People are really proud of them \u2013 they are so intricate,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have any artistic talent but what you create is unique. People send us pictures of them, framed and laminated. The appetite is simply enormous. I reckon people are taking their kids\u2019 pictures off the fridge and replacing them with their own.\u201d"}
