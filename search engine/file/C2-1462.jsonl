{"id": "C2-1462", "contents": "Nairobi National Park is a protected ecosystem where various types of wildlife find hiding place. The\npark has in the recent past experienced destruction through construction of a standard gauge railway\n(SGR) line and a highway called the Southern bypass. These developments raise concern with the\npossibility that their combined environmental cost being enormous. This study sought to determine the\nwillingness to pay (WTP) for the restoration of the park attributes using discrete choice experiment. The\nfocus was on the attributes of (1) wildlife population and diversity of species, (2) wildlife movement in\ndispersion and migration areas, (3) vegetation density and diversity, (4) security of wildlife and people,\nand (5) environmental safety and quality. The data used was collected from 93 students of Kisii\nUniversity, Nairobi campus. A price attribute in form of an increase in gate fee was included to elicit\nWTP estimates. Multinomial logit regression estimates indicated that respondents were WTP for the\nrestoration of all the attributes except attribute 4. Attributes 1 and 2 elicited the highest WTP and could\nbe the most affected by the two projects. Middle-aged respondents with stable jobs were likely to pay\nmore for the restoration of the attributes compared to students and the youth. Based on the findings,\nthe government could consider relocating the park to a place with better environmental attributes.\nKey words: Nairobi National Park, ecosystem, discrete choice experiment, willingness to pay, park attributes,\nMultinomial logit.\nINTRODUCTION\nNairobi National Park (NNP) ecosystem provides\nnumerous use benefits (direct and indirect) and non-use\nbenefits that include existence, option and bequest\nvalues. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005)\ndefines ecosystem as a complex and dynamic\nenvironment where living organisms (plants, animals and\nmicroorganisms) and non-living organisms interact and\nfunction as a unit. An ecosystem provides services to\nhuman beings that the World Resources Institute (2005)\ndefines as benefits.\nThe park is Kenya\u2019s oldest dating back to 1946. It\nmeasures approximately 117 km2\nand is situated at 7 km\nsouth of Nairobi\u2019s central business district (GoK, 2012).\nPerhaps Kenya is the only country in the world with a\nnational park in its capital city. According to the Kenya\nWildlife Service (KWS), the park is home to over 100\nmammalian species including the endangered black\nrhino, four of the big five wildlife (lion, buffalo, leopard\n*Corresponding author.

The park currently charges gate fee of Ksh 430 to\ncitizens and Ksh 4300 to foreigners. Approximately\n278,700 tourists, both local and international, visited the\npark in 2017, this makes the park a significant contributor\nto the tourism industry (KNBS, 2018).\nNairobi National Park is protected and regulated by The\nConstitution of Kenya (2010), the Wildlife Conservation\nand Management Act (2013) and the Environmental\nManagement and Conservation Act (1999). These\nstatutes provide the legal framework for protection,\nsustainable management and use of the country\u2019s\nenvironment and natural resources (GoK, 1999, 2010,\n2013)."}
