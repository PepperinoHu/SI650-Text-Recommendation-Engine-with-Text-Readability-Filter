{"id": "C1-748", "contents": "\ufeffThey are the darkness seekers \u2013 and they are growing in number. On Black Fell, looking down on Northumberland\u2019s beautiful Kielder Water reservoir, a group of people wait in a car park next to a strange wooden building with a minimalist design beamed down from the future. This is Kielder Observatory, the centre of Britain\u2019s nascent astrotourism industry. And those waiting outside were the lucky ones. Many more had applied for a night of stargazing at the observatory but numbers are strictly limited. \nInside, next to a woodburner and under dimmed lights, the observatory\u2019s founder and lead astronomer, Gary Fildes, a former bricklayer with Tarzan hair, delivers a pep talk to his colleagues and volunteers. The team discusses the prospect of seeing the northern lights but Fildes is doubtful. Instead, they decide to train their powerful telescopes on Jupiter and Venus and later to pick out stars such as Capella and Betelgeuse. An additional attraction is the appearance of the International Space Station. \n\u201cRemember,\u201d Fildes tells his team, \u201cit\u2019s about interaction, it\u2019s about entertainment, it\u2019s about inspiring people.\u201d He puts on some music. Pink Floyd, the Jam, the Pogues. \u201cBy 9.30, the sky is going to be sexy,\u201d Fildes says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be epic.\u201d \nFildes, 49, is at the forefront of the UK\u2019s burgeoning astrotourism industry. The pivotal moment for Northumberland came in 2013 when the entire national park housing Hadrian\u2019s Wall, along with Kielder Water and Forest Park, some 1,500 sq km, was awarded Dark Sky Park status, the only one in England. Dark Sky Parks are rare. The 2013 Star Count revealed that only 5% of the UK population can see more than 31 stars on a good night. \nThe Tucson, Arizona-based International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) confers the status only on places that take major steps to avoid light pollution. Recipients must also prove their night skies are sufficiently dark. In Northumberland Dark Sky Park, as the area was rebadged, it is so dark that Venus casts a shadow on the Earth. \nDuncan Wise, visitor development officer for the Northumberland National Park Authority, helped to spearhead the campaign for dark-sky status after the Council for the Protection of Rural England found it was one of Britain\u2019s most tranquil places. \u201cWe tend to look at landscape as everything up to the horizon,\u201d Wise said. \u201cBut what about what\u2019s above it?\u201d Wise and others spent years drawing up their submission to the IDA, collecting reams of light readings and forming an alliance of local councils, parks\u2019 bodies and community groups to produce an exterior lighting master plan that influences the construction of new developments in the area. \nTheir efforts have been vindicated. Many of the 1.5 million who visit Northumberland each year are now aware of its Dark Sky status. \u201cWe get a lot of people coming here to see the sky now,\u201d says the man at the car-hire firm in Newcastle. \u201cThey come in autumn and winter, when it\u2019s darkest. Good for the B&Bs as they get business all year round now.\u201d Local hoteliers now issue guests with night-vision torches and put out deckchairs at night. Those who have acquired some knowledge of astronomy can receive a badge confirming that their hotels are \u201cDark Sky Friendly\u201d. \nWise acknowledges that Northumberland needs to do more to capitalize on its scarce resource and believes the region needs a couple more observatories to ensure that visitors will see what they came for. A \u00a314m national landscape discovery centre, which he describes as the north\u2019s answer to the Eden Project, will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years. \nFildes has grand designs. He is planning Britain\u2019s first \u201castrovillage\u201d, one that would house the largest public observatory in the world and boast a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, a one-metre aperture telescope, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes. The multimillion-pound project would feature a hotel and draw in 100,000 people a year, four times the number currently able to use the observatory. Fildes is cryptic about his backers but believes the astrovillage will be a reality by 2018. \nHowever, Northumberland faces competition. Galloway Forest Park in Scotland also has Dark Sky Park status. Since Exmoor was designated Europe\u2019s first International Dark Sky Reserve \u2013 one notch below Dark Sky Park \u2013 in 2011, a range of local businesses offering stargazing breaks and safaris has sprung up. The UK will have to go some way to eclipse northern Chile, which boasts more than a dozen tourist observatories and has some of the clearest skies in the world. The Teide National Park in Tenerife is also becoming a major astrotourism destination. \nSo, what is driving the desire to look upwards? The media have helped. TV presenters like Brian Cox have attracted a new generation of stargazers. \u201cBrian Cox has made astronomy accessible,\u201d says Wise. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer seen as the province of professors in studies with brass telescopes.\u201d Technology has also played a part. Apps such as Stellarium now turn smartphones into pocket-size planetariums. Ultimately, though, Fildes believes people are starting to appreciate what lies above. \u201cIf you had to build a visitor attraction from scratch, what could be better than the universe?\u201d"}
