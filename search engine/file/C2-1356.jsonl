{"id": "C2-1356", "contents": "Land threatens the overall economy of Ethiopia.\nParticularly, the agricultural sector which is a source of\n45% of the country\u201fs GDP and 85% of employment is\nhighly vulnerable to the problem of land degradation\n(Gebrelibanos and Abdi, 2012; MoFED, 2013). Based on\nthis, the creation of conducive atmosphere for better\nperformance of the agricultural sector is not only an\nimportant and realistic option to improve food security\nstatus of Ethiopians but also a means to improve their\nstandard of living. However, recently due to changes in\nwatersheds in general and land degradation in particular\nwhich resulted from a range of natural and anthropogenic\nfactors, the agricultural sector has been challenged and\nthe extent of fertile land available for this sector is\ndecreasing; this can reduce productivity, household\u201fs\nfood security, and aggravate poverty in degraded areas\nof the country (MoA, 2012; Teklewold and Kohlin, 2011;\nGebrelibanos and Abdi, 2012).\nOn the other hand, Woldeamlak (2003), Mushir and\nKedru (2012), Abebaw et al. (2011), FAO (2012),\nBefikadu and Frank (2015) argued that land management\npractices in Ethiopia have fallen far below expectations\nand land degradation mainly caused by erosion remains\nwidespread in the country. They further argued that the\nadoption rate of conservation practices by farmers\nremains limited and still the country is losing a\ntremendous amount of fertile top soil, and the threat of\nland degradation is broadening alarmingly. In view of this,\nthe Ethiopian Government and other developmental\npartners have introduced an extensive mechanical and\nbiological watershed conservation schemes in various\nparts of the country over the last decades particularly\nafter the famine of the 1970s (Emily and Fanaye, 2012;\nBinyam and Desale, 2014)."}
