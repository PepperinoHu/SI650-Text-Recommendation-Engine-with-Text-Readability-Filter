The decline of coal consumption in the US has helped to cut prices for coal globally. This has made it more attractive, even in Europe where coal use was supposed to be discouraged by the Emissions Trading Scheme. \nMaria van der Hoeven, Executive Director of the IEA, said: \u201cCoal\u2019s share of the global energy mix continues to grow each year and, if no changes are made to current policies, coal will catch oil within a decade.\u201d \nCoal is abundant and found in most regions of the world, unlike conventional oil and gas, and can be cheaply extracted. As a result, coal was used to meet nearly half of the rise in demand for energy globally in the past decade. According to the IEA, demand from China and India will drive world coal use in the coming five years, with India likely to overtake the US as the world\u2019s second biggest consumer. China is the biggest coal importer, and Indonesia the biggest exporter, having temporarily overtaken Australia. \nAccording to the IEA\u2019s Medium-Term Coal Market Report the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today \u2013 the equivalent of the current coal consumption of Russia and the US combined. Global coal consumption is forecast to reach 4.3bn tonnes of oil equivalent by 2017, while oil consumption is forecast to reach 4.4bn tonnes by the same date. \nWith the highest carbon emissions of any major fossil fuel, coal is a huge contributor to climate change, particularly when burned in old-fashioned, inefficient power stations. When these are not equipped with special \u201cscrubbing\u201d equipment to remove chemicals, coal can also produce sulphur emissions \u2013 the leading cause of acid rain \u2013 and other pollutants such as mercury and soot particles. \nVan der Hoeven said that, without a high carbon price to discourage the growth in coal use and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable power generation, only competition from lower-priced gas could realistically cut demand for coal. This has happened in the US, owing to the extraordinary increase in the production of shale gas in that market in the past five years. \nShe said: \u201cThe US experience suggests that a more efficient gas market, marked by flexible pricing and fuelled by indigenous unconventional resources that are produced sustainably, can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions and consumers\u2019 electricity bills. Europe, China and other regions should take note.\u201d \nThat would mean producing much more shale gas, as conventional gas resources are running down in their easily accessible locations. \nIn Europe, the Emissions Trading Scheme was supposed to discourage high-carbon power generation by imposing a price on carbon dioxide emissions. This was done through issuing generators and energy-intensive companies with a set quota of emissions permits, requiring them to buy extra permits if they needed to emit more than their allowance. But an over-allocation, coupled with the effects of the financial crisis and recession, has led to a large surplus of permits on the market, which has in turn led to a plunge in permit prices. At current levels \u2013 a few euros per tonne of carbon \u2013 there is little incentive to seek out lower carbon fuels, and coal is enjoying a renaissance in Europe. \nThat means one of the world\u2019s only regulatory market mechanisms aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions is failing in its key goals. The world faces the likelihood of an increased risk of climate change as a result of this runaway consumption of the highest carbon fossil fuel."}
