The 43-year-old actor, originally from France, had spent 20 years living in Copenhagen and looking for love in the hope of raising children. He recently took his quest online but was dismayed by the results. \n\u201cI got frustrated with everyone trying to sell themselves as really active, always travelling or with a long list of hobbies, but no mention of children,\u201d Limal said. \u201cOn some sites, there was an option to click, saying: 'I\u2019d like kids someday,' but you would read the person\u2019s profile and think: 'You will never have time!' If someone\u2019s going to the gym eight times a week and travelling every month, they are not putting a family first.\u201d \nLimal has a six-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, but coming from a big family \u2013 his father is one of 11 \u2013 he has always wanted more children. \u201cI couldn\u2019t seem to meet anyone willing to prioritize starting a family and struggled with when to mention wanting kids any time I met someone new. It\u2019s the ultimate dating taboo,\u201d he said. \u201cThen one day I read a profile from a 38-year-old who said she knew it was 'really bad to admit' but she wanted children. And I just thought: 'You shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of this.'\u201d \nLimal remortgaged his apartment to fund the setting up of Babyklar.nu \u2013 or 'baby-ready now' in English. It functions like a normal dating site but every potential dater is asked to be honest about their wish to start a family soon. \u201cWe ask people if they are OK with someone who already has children as well as wanting another baby,\u201d Limal said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t make them specify how many children they\u2019d like. That would be a bit too much like grocery shopping online.\u201d \nThe response to the site has been overwhelming, he said. \u201cWe had 50 sign-ups an hour when we launched in June and we are already hearing from couples who have met through the site and are now together. I\u2019m fully expecting the first Babyklar.nu baby by next summer.\u201d More men have signed up than women (53% to 47%), with testimonials such as \u201cIt\u2019s so lovely to be able to say this out loud\u201d and \u201cI finally dare to be honest about what I want.\u201d \nThe site has come at an opportune time for the country of five million people. Danes are not having enough babies, according to a report from the Copenhagen hospital Rigshospitalet, and the current rate of 1.7 children per family is not enough to maintain Denmark\u2019s population. The usual suspects are being blamed for the new low \u2013 women leaving it \u201ctoo late\u201d and couples cohabiting and waiting to start families. \n\u201cNow, I hope, men and women who want to start a family but haven\u2019t met the right person yet will have another option,\u201d says Limal. He\u2019s keen to point out that this isn\u2019t just about baby farming: \u201cI want this to be about children and love. My goal is to pair up people who really want a family and a partner \u2013 and who\u2019ll stay together. I\u2019m a romantic at heart.\u201d \nThere are plans to roll out the site in France and the UK later in 2013, but for now it is the Danes who are reaping the benefits. \u201cDanes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move fast and, because the country\u2019s so small, a Jutlander can date a Copenhagener without too much travel,\u201d Limal said. What\u2019s more, Limal has finally found love. \u201cI\u2019ve met a nice woman and she wants a baby too \u2013 so we shall see.\u201d"}
