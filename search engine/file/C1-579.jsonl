Others are not so sure: technical progress past this point isn\u2019t merely a matter of invention; it\u2019s a matter of public safety. \nPaul Misener, Amazon\u2019s vice-president of global public policy, told a congressional hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place \u2013 but Misener gave no hints as to what that would look like beyond joking with a congressman that there was a basket of fresh fruit on the way to his doorstep to demonstrate the technology\u2019s viability. \nThe Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) will finally have regulations governing the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016. But the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines aren\u2019t airway-legal at all yet \u2013 only drones up to 25kg will be covered and the FAA points out in the proposed rules that, if you\u2019re going to crowd the skies with radio-controlled flying robots, they had better all be using different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack. Professor Sajiv Singh of Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute, who runs a \u201ccritical cargo delivery\u201d company called NearEarth, said that piloting a state-of-the-art drone was a little more like leaving it a trail of breadcrumbs: go to this altitude, perform this short task, go back home. But even short flights from a mobile landing pad pose serious logistical problems, he said. \n\u201cThey\u2019re not proposing to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; they\u2019re proposing to deliver from a warehouse to where the consumer is, which is likely an urban area or a suburban area,\u201d he said. \u201cIn those particular cases, there are going to be hazards along the way that the vehicle is going to have to detect. Maybe there will be terrain that the map doesn\u2019t know about, unless you\u2019ve mapped that exact route before. Even then, maybe there\u2019s construction equipment that wasn\u2019t there but is there now. Maybe GPS signals are blocked or partially blocked, in which case it\u2019s going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.\u201d All this is surmountable, he said \u2013 but it\u2019s difficult. One major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks. \u201cIf you have an off-the-shelf UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle], it\u2019ll just keep going and crash into the ground,\u201d said roboticist Daniel Huber. \nThat\u2019s not a hard problem for an engineer to fix; it\u2019s just that the fix isn\u2019t yet an industry standard. \nFurthermore, \u201cyou can\u2019t do everything with a 25kg aircraft\u201d, said Jay McConville, director of business development for unmanned systems at defence and business contractor Lockheed Martin MST. Much of the focus at Lockheed Martin has been on making drone piloting interfaces less like elaborate flight simulators. \u201cThose of us in the aircraft business have to remind ourselves that the operator doesn\u2019t really care about every little thing about the aircraft and wants instead to focus on the end result,\u201d he said. \u201cOperators want to see vehicle status information; they want to see video on their handheld device or their laptop.\u201d \u201cTechnologically, most of the things that are needed for this are in place,\u201d said Huber. \nHe is working on a program that proposes using drones to inspect infrastructure \u2013 pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and it\u2019ll autonomously fly around that area and look at every surface and then report back.\u201d \nHuber, a senior scientist at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Robotics Institute, where he works on 3D systems imagery, said with respect to a program like Amazon\u2019s: \u201cI have heard them say that many packages are lightweight \u2013 a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes. If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that base. You need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have about that distance.\u201d It\u2019s one way, he said, of making sure the surrounding population is relatively safe. \u201cThe larger you get, the more dangerous you get.\u201d Logistical problems are in the middle of being solved in some very dramatic ways, Huber said. At a recent conference, he said, a disaster relief drone firm, SkyCatch, demonstrated a robot that could autonomously take off and, when it got tired, land on its own charging station. \u201cIt would land and take off and, when it ran low on batteries, it would land, exchange the batteries and take off again,\u201d he said. \nOf course, safety remains a major concern \u2013 Singh points out that, for a commercial aircraft to be considered skyworthy, it has to prove a rate of one serious failure every 1m hours. Drones, he said, are \u201cone or two orders of magnitude away\u201d from that benchmark. \u201cThe Reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours,\u201d Singh said. An oil leak, by the way, doesn\u2019t count as catastrophic failure \u2013 something has to fall out of the sky. \u201cWe\u2019re closing the gap,\u201d Singh said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest.\u201d \nPart of this is simply that air travel is inherently dangerous and, thus, standards are much higher. \u201cIf you fly commercial airlines, often they\u2019ll say, \u2019Oh, a component has failed \u2013 we have to go back to the gate,\u2019\u201d Singh said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an established industry with 60 years of legacy! I shudder to think that one of these things might come down on a crowded highway.\u201d Part of the solution, Singh said, is simple contingency planning: \u201cIf things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.\u201d"}
