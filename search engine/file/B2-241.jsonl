While he will become a United director and ambassador, the club will now have to find someone to replace a man who has won 13 English Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues, the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup, five FA Cups and four League Cups. \nRegarding his decision, Ferguson said: \u201cThe decision to retire is one that I have thought a great deal about and one that I have not taken lightly. It is the right time. It was important to me to leave an organization in the strongest possible shape and I believe I have done so. The quality of this league-winning squad, and the balance of ages within it, bodes well for continued success at the highest level whilst the structure of the youth set-up will ensure that the long-term future of the club remains a bright one. \n\u201cOur training facilities are amongst the finest in global sport and our home, Old Trafford, is rightfully regarded as one of the leading venues in the world. Going forward, I am delighted to take on the roles of both director and ambassador for the club. With these activities, along with my many other interests, I am looking forward to the future. I must pay tribute to my family; their love and support has been essential. My wife, Cathy, has been the key figure throughout my career, providing a bedrock of both stability and encouragement. Words are not enough to express what this has meant to me. \n\u201cAs for my players and staff, past and present, I would like to thank them all for a staggering level of professional conduct and dedication that has helped to deliver so many memorable triumphs. Without their contribution, the history of this great club would not be as rich. In my early years, the backing of the board, and Sir Bobby Charlton in particular, gave me the confidence and time to build a football club, rather than just a football team. \n\u201cOver the past decade, the Glazer family have provided me with the platform to manage Manchester United to the best of my ability and \nI have been extremely fortunate to have worked with a talented and trustworthy chief executive in David Gill. I am truly grateful to all of them. To the fans, thank you. The support you have provided over the years has been truly humbling. It has been an honour and an enormous privilege to have had the opportunity to lead your club and I have treasured my time as manager of Manchester United.\u201d \nThe sudden nature of Ferguson\u2019s departure is in keeping with how the Scot stated he would leave the post after he mentioned a first retirement during the 2001/2 season before performing a U-turn. It is understood he gathered the players in the first-team changing room shortly after they arrived for training on Wednesday morning. In an emotional speech, he announced he was to step down. He then took his backroom staff aside before finally addressing the rest of the staff in the canteen. \nJoel Glazer, joint owner of Manchester United, said: \u201cAlex has proven time and time again what a fantastic manager he is but he\u2019s also a wonderful person. His determination to succeed and dedication to the club have been truly remarkable. I will always cherish the wonderful memories he has given us, like that magical night in Moscow.\u201d \nAvie Glazer, his brother, said: \u201cI am delighted to announce that Alex has agreed to stay with the club as a director. His contributions to Manchester United over the last 27 years have been extraordinary and, like all United fans, I want him to be a part of its future.\u201d \nDavid Gill, the outgoing chief executive, said: \u201cI\u2019ve had the tremendous pleasure of working very closely with Alex for 16 unforgettable years \u2013 through the treble, the double, countless trophy wins and numerous signings. We knew that his retirement would come one day and we both have been planning for it by ensuring the quality of the squad and club structures are in first-class condition. Alex\u2019s vision, energy and ability have built teams \u2013 both on and off the pitch \u2013 that his successor can count on as among the best and most loyal in world sport. \n\u201cThe way he cares for this club, his staff and for the football family in general is something that I admire. It is a side to him that is often hidden from public view but it is something that I have been privileged to witness in the last 16 years. \nWhat he has done for this club and for the game in general will never be forgotten. It has been the greatest experience of my working life being alongside Alex and a great honour to be able to call him a friend.\u201d \nFirst-team coach Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen revealed how Ferguson broke the news to his backroom staff on Wednesday morning. \u201cI found out this morning when I came to the club,\u201d he said. \u201cHe called us into his office and told us what decision he had taken. It\u2019s always been on the cards \u2013 there\u2019s speculation every season. I think the manager kept his cards close to his chest. I think he felt the time was right now and he made a decision. \n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously a man who thinks very, very hard so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s put a lot of thought into making this decision. I wish him well. He\u2019s been fantastic for this club and I hope all the fans give whoever\u2019s going to come in the same support that he gets.\u201d"}
