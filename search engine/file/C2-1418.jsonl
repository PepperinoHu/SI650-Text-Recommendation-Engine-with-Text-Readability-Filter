That was 1977 but, in 2015, as the franchise approaches its seventh big-screen instalment, interest in Star Wars shows no sign of abating \u2013 now, there is news of a new film about Han Solo and of a reappearance for Darth Vader. \u201cCountless fans around the world are in a constant state of vigilance waiting for the release of new poster art, new trailers and other information,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at box-office monitor Rentrak. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine any other movie franchise that could evoke such a level of passion, enthusiasm and excitement.\u201d \nThe latest Star Wars mania dates from the Hollywood studio Disney\u2019s purchase of Lucasfilm from the film\u2019s creator, George Lucas, in 2012; the $4bn acquisition was accompanied by an announcement of three more sequential \u201cepisodes\u201d \u2013 VII, VIII and IX \u2013 plus then unspecified plans for spin-off movies and \u201cstand-alones\u201d to fill the gaps in the release schedule. Details of the second spin-off have now been made public: an \u201corigins story\u201d about Han Solo, the intergalactic smuggler played by Harrison Ford in the first three films, which is scheduled to be released in May 2018. \nIt will follow the release in December 2015 of Episode VII, directed by JJ Abrams and titled Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the unnamed Episode VIII due out in 2017 and the already announced spin-off, Rogue One, which will arrive in cinemas in 2016. \nThat movie will outline a rebel mission to steal the plans of the Death Star, a key plot element of the first film in 1977. Levels of interest in the rumour that Rogue One will also feature the reappearance of Darth Vader, the black-clad villain of the original series, only confirmed the power of Star Wars nostalgia. \nIn creating a multi-stranded, multi-character cinema \u201cuniverse\u201d around Star Wars, Lucasfilm-Disney are taking their cue from the phenomenally successful series of films produced by Marvel Studios, which Disney also acquired, in 2009.  \nDisney has brought a whole new level of marketing savvy to an already popular product: Dergarabedian cites the decision to make all six existing Star Wars films available on streaming services as \u201ca brilliant way to build the anticipation for the new film and reinvigorate the idea of Star Wars in the minds of the fans\u201d. \nWhether it needs reinvigorating is questionable. The level of enthusiasm that has surrounded Star Wars for at least the last two decades is evidenced by what has become known as the \u201cExpanded Universe\u201d: the plethora of novels, comic books, video games and merchandising that Lucasfilm has created or licensed over the years. \nThis extra material began emerging as far back as 1978 but was given a massive kick by the mushrooming of the internet in the 1990s. Role-play and fan participation show no sign of slowing: in the UK, event-cinema brand Secret Cinema have found considerable commercial success with their live staging of The Empire Strikes Back. \nMichael Rosser, news editor for Screen International, suggests that it is this \u201cshared universe\u201d of highly infectious nostalgia that keeps Star Wars in pole position among film franchises. \u201cThe great thing about the original films was that they created a huge universe of characters and possibility that sparked the imagination of viewers,\u201d he said. \n\u201cFor years, people have been wondering how the different strands would play out. This new film, because it\u2019s going back to Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, looks as though it will reconnect with the original Star Wars in a way that the prequels failed to.\u201d \nRosser is referring to the three films Lucas directed between 1999 and 2005 \u2013 The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith \u2013 which chronicled the life of Luke Skywalker\u2019s father, Anakin, who transforms into Darth Vader. Despite being greeted with less-than-stellar reviews, the prequels took $2.5bn at the worldwide box office, shortly after the release of restored and augmented \u201cspecial editions\u201d of the first trilogy had netted $469m in 1997. \n\u201cIt shows the power of Star Wars that, although they were disappointing, the prequels still managed to make a lot of money,\u201d said Rosser. \nIn a film business where branding is all and a successful franchise the answer to everybody\u2019s prayers, is there a risk that movie studios will simply become branding machines and lose their interest in cinema for its own sake? \nRosser thinks not. \u201cThey are desperate to ensure the longevity of the franchise and make sure the quality is kept up. They are also trying to bring people into the cinema at a time when lots are staying home for entertainment. But you don\u2019t want to watch Star Wars on your iPhone so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to run out of steam any time soon.\u201d \nMeanwhile, Dergarabedian is anticipating massive business when The Force Awakens reaches cinemas in December 2015. \u201cWe are certainly looking at a record opening for December and it should go on to make at least a billion dollars worldwide. Truly, Star Wars is the ultimate movie brand.\u201d"}
