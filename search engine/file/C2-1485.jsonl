{"id": "C2-1485", "contents": "One promising place to begin understanding transcendental idealism is to look at the other philosophical positions from which Kant distinguishes it. In the \u201cFourth Paralogism\u201d, he distinguishes transcendental idealism from transcendental realism:\nTo this [transcendental] idealism is opposed transcendental realism, which regards space and time as something given in themselves (independent of our sensibility). The transcendental realist therefore represents outer appearances (if their reality is conceded) as things in themselves [Dinge an sich selbst], which would exist independently of us and our sensibility and thus would also be outside us according to pure concepts of the understanding. (A369)\nTranscendental realism, according to this passage, is the view that objects in space and time exist independently of our experience of them, while transcendental idealism denies this. This point is reiterated later in the Critique when Kant writes:\nWe have sufficiently proved in the Transcendental Aesthetic that everything intuited in space or in time, hence all objects of an experience possible for us, are nothing but appearances, i.e., mere representations, which, as they are represented, as extended beings or series of alterations, have outside our thoughts no existence grounded in itself. This doctrine I call transcendental idealism. The realist, in the transcendental signification, makes these modifications of our sensibility into things subsisting in themselves, and hence makes mere representations into things in themselves [Sachen an sich selbst]. (A491/B519)[3]\nAppearances exist at least partly in virtue of our experience of them, while the existence of things in themselves is not grounded in our experience at all (cf. A369, A492/B521, A493/B522). Kant calls transcendental realism the \u201ccommon prejudice\u201d (A740/B768) and describes it as a \u201ccommon but fallacious presupposition\u201d (A536/B564; cf. Allison 2004: 22). Transcendental realism is the commonsense pre-theoretic view that objects in space and time are \u201cthings in themselves\u201d, which Kant, of course, denies.\nKant also distinguishes transcendental idealism from another position he calls \u201cempirical idealism\u201d:\nOne would also do us an injustice if one tried to ascribe to us that long-decried empirical idealism that, while assuming the proper reality of space, denies the existence of extended beings in it, or at least finds this existence doubtful, and so in this respect admits no satisfactorily provable distinction between dream and truth. As to the appearances of inner sense in time, it finds no difficulty in them as real things, indeed, it even asserts that this inner experience and it alone gives sufficient proof of the real existence of their object (in itself) along with all this time-determination. (A491/B519)\nEmpirical idealism, as Kant here characterizes it, is the view that all we know immediately (non-inferentially) is the existence of our own minds and our temporally ordered mental states, while we can only infer the existence of objects \u201coutside\u201d us in space. Since the inference from a known effect to an unknown cause is always uncertain, the empirical idealist concludes we cannot know that objects exist outside us in space. Kant typically distinguishes two varieties of empirical idealism: dogmatic idealism, which claims that objects in space do not exist, and problematic idealism, which claims that objects in space may exist, but we cannot know whether they do (see A377). Although he is never mentioned by name in the A Edition, Berkeley seems to be Kant\u2019s paradigm dogmatic idealist, while Descartes is named as the paradigm problematic idealist.[4]\nTranscendental idealism is a form of empirical realism because it entails that we have immediate (non-inferential) and certain knowledge of the existence of objects in space merely through self-consciousness:\n[\u2026] external objects (bodies) are merely appearances, hence also nothing other than a species of my representations, whose objects are something only through these representations, but are nothing separated from them. Thus external things exist as well as my self, and indeed both exist on the immediate testimony of my self-consciousness, only with this difference: the representation of my Self, as the thinking subject is related merely to inner sense, but the representations that designate extended beings are also related to outer sense. I am no more necessitated to draw inferences in respect of the reality of external objects than I am in regard to the reality of my inner sense (my thoughts), for in both cases they are nothing but representations, the immediate perception (consciousness) of which is at the same time a sufficient proof of their reality. (A370\u20131)\nMerely through self-conscious introspection I can know that I have representations with certain contents and since appearances are \u201cnothing other than a species of my representations\u201d this constitutes immediate and certain knowledge of the existence of objects in space.\nUnderstanding transcendental idealism requires understanding the precise sense in which things in themselves are, and appearances are not, \u201cexternal to\u201d or \u201cindependent\u201d of the mind and Kant draws a helpful distinction between two senses in which objects can be \u201coutside me\u201d:\nBut since the expression outside us carries with it an unavoidable ambiguity, since it sometimes signifies something that, as a thing in itself [Ding an sich selbst], exists distinct from us and sometimes merely that belongs to outer appearance, then in order to escape uncertainty and use this concept in the latter significance\u2014in which it is taken in the proper psychological question about the reality of our outer intuition\u2014we will distinguish empirically external objects from those that might be called \u201cexternal\u201d in the transcendental sense, by directly calling them \u201cthings that are to be encountered in space\u201d. (A373)\nIn the transcendental sense, an object is \u201coutside me\u201d when its existence does not depend (even partly) on my representations of it. The empirical sense of \u201coutside me\u201d depends upon the distinction between outer and inner sense. Inner sense is the sensible intuition of my inner states (which are themselves appearances); time is the form of inner sense, meaning that all the states we intuit in inner sense are temporally ordered. Outer sense is the sensible intuition of objects that are not my inner states; space is the form of outer sense. In the empirical sense, \u201couter\u201d simply refers to objects of outer sense, objects in space. Transcendental idealism is the view that objects in space are \u201couter\u201d in the empirical sense but not in the transcendental sense. Things in themselves are transcendentally \u201couter\u201d but appearances are not."}
