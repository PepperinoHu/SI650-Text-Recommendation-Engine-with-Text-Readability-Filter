{"id": "C2-1488", "contents": "\ufeffBrazil experienced one of its biggest nights of protest in decades as more than 100,000 people took to the streets nationwide to express their frustration at heavy-handed policing, poor public services and high costs for the World Cup. \nThe major demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasilia, Belem, Belo Horizonte, Salvador and elsewhere started peacefully, but several led to clashes with police and arson attacks on cars and buses. \nThe large turnout and geographic spread marked a rapid escalation after previous, smaller protests against bus price increases led to complaints that police responded disproportionately with rubber bullets, tear gas and violent beatings. \nCoinciding with the start of the Confederations Cup \u2013 a World Cup test event \u2013 the rallies brought together a wide coalition of people frustrated with the escalating costs and persistently poor quality of public services, lavish investment in international sporting events, low standards of health care and wider unease about inequality and corruption. \nWhile the vast majority of demonstrations in Rio were peaceful, several police were injured in clashes at the city\u2019s legislative assembly, at least one car was overturned and burned, and windows were smashed in the offices of banks and notary offices. \nThe unrest escalated during the night as a large crowd set several fires outside the legislative assembly, smashed the building\u2019s windows and painted graffiti on the walls proclaiming \u201cRevolution\u201d, \u201cDown with Paes, down with Cabral [the mayor and state governor]\u201d and \u201cHate police\u201d. Police inside responded with pepper spray and perhaps more \u2013 the Guardian saw one protester passed out and bleeding heavily from a wound in the upper arm. \nThe causes pursued by the protesters varied widely. \u201cWe are here because we hate the government. They do nothing for us,\u201d said Oscar Jos\u00e9 Santos, a 19 year old who was with a group of hooded youths from the Rocinha favela. \n\u201cI\u2019m an architect but I have been unemployed for six months. There must be something wrong with this country,\u201d said Nadia al Husin, holding up a banner calling on the government to do more for education. \nAt a far smaller rally in Brasilia, demonstrators broke through police lines to enter the high-security area of the national congress. Several climbed onto the roof. \nIn Belo Horizonte, police clashed with protesters who tried to break through a cordon around a football stadium hosting a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti. \nIn Porto Alegre, demonstrators set fire to a bus and, in Curitiba, protesters attempted to force their way into the office of the state governor. There were also rallies in Belem, Salvador and elsewhere. \nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, which had seen the fiercest clashes the previous week and the main allegations of police violence, large crowds gathered once again but initial reports suggested the marches passed peacefully. \nReflecting the importance of social networks in spreading the message about the protests, some in S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 where numbers were estimated at between 30,000 and 100,000 \u2013 carried banners declaring \u201cWe come from Facebook\u201d. \nMost protesters were young and, for many, it was their first experience of such a giant rally. \u201cMy generation has never experienced this,\u201d said Thiago Firbida, a student. \u201cSince the dictatorship, Brazilians never bothered to take over the streets. They did not believe they had a reason to. But now Brazil is once again in crisis, with a constant rise in prices, so people are finally reacting.\u201d \nComparisons have been drawn with rallies in Turkey and elsewhere. Another global link was evident in the handful of demonstrators who wore Guy Fawkes masks, associated with Anonymous and the Occupy Wall Street protests. \nBrazil\u2019s demonstrations are being referred to as the \u201cvinegar revolution\u201d (after police arrested people for carrying vinegar to counter tear gas), as well as the \u201c20-cent revolution\u201d (due to the bus price rise) and the Passe Livre (after the demand for free public transport). \nSome said the protests felt un-Brazilian but liberating. \u201cOur politicians need to see the strength we have as one people. Brazilians tend to be too nice sometimes \u2013 they enjoy partying rather than protesting \u2013 but something is changing,\u201d said Deli Borsari, a 53-year-old yoga instructor. \nFollowing widespread news coverage of the costs of new and refurbished stadiums, the Confederations Cup football tournament has been one of the focuses of the protests. Before the opening match in Brasilia, crowds of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police. Footage showed frightened Japanese supporters rushing from the area holding their children, as the sound of shots \u2013 perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas \u2013 was heard. \nAnother protest march, near Rio\u2019s Maracana Stadium, was met with a similarly heavy police response. \nMost of the rallies appeared to start peacefully until they confronted the security forces, who are largely organized at a regional level. President Dilma Rousseff condones the protests, according to her aides. \u201cThe president believes peaceful protests are legitimate and proper for a democracy, and that it is natural for young people to demonstrate,\u201d said Helena Chagas of the president\u2019s office. \nHowever, the president was booed at the opening ceremony for the Confederations Cup. With the economy in bad shape and social unrest on the rise, she faces a serious political challenge, both now and in 2014, when Brazil will not only host the World Cup but also have a presidential election."}
