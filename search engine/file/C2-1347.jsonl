{"id": "C2-1347", "contents": "Although the term \u201cnationalism\u201d has a variety of meanings, it centrally encompasses two phenomena: (1) the attitude that the members of a nation have when they care about their identity as members of that nation and (2) the actions that the members of a nation take in seeking to achieve (or sustain) some form of political sovereignty (see for example, Nielsen 1998\u20139: 9). Each of these aspects requires elaboration.\nraises questions about the concept of a nation or national identity, about what it is to belong to a nation, and about how much one ought to care about one\u2019s nation. Nations and national identity may be defined in terms of common origin, ethnicity, or cultural ties, and while an individual\u2019s membership in the nation is often regarded as involuntary, it is sometimes regarded as voluntary. The degree of care for one\u2019s nation that nationalists require is often, but not always, taken to be very high: according to such views, the claims of one\u2019s nation take precedence over rival contenders for authority and loyalty.[1]\nraises questions about whether sovereignty requires the acquisition of full statehood with complete authority over domestic and international affairs, or whether something less than statehood suffices. Although sovereignty is often taken to mean full statehood (Gellner 1983: ch. 1),[2] possible exceptions have been recognized (Miller 1992: 87; Miller 2000). Some authors even defend an anarchist version of patriotism-moderate nationalism foreshadowed by Bakunin (see Sparrow 2007).\nThere is a terminological and conceptual question of distinguishing nationalism from patriotism. A popular proposal is the contrast between attachment to one\u2019s country as defining patriotism and attachment to one\u2019s people and its traditions as defining nationalism (Kleinig 2014: 228, and Primoratz 2017: Section 1.2). One problem with this proposal is that love for a country is not really just love of a piece of land but normally involves attachment to the community of its inhabitants, and this introduces \u201cnation\u201d into the conception of patriotism. Another contrast is the one between strong, and somewhat aggressive attachment (nationalism) and a mild one (patriotism), dating back at least to George Orwell (see his 1945 essay).[3]\nDespite these definitional worries, there is a fair amount of agreement about the classical, historically paradigmatic form of nationalism. It typically features the supremacy of the nation\u2019s claims over other claims to individual allegiance and full sovereignty as the persistent aim of its political program. Territorial sovereignty has traditionally been seen as a defining element of state power and essential for nationhood. It was extolled in classic modern works by Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau and is returning to center stage in the debate, though philosophers are now more skeptical (see below). Issues surrounding the control of the movement of money and people (in particular immigration) and the resource rights implied in territorial sovereignty make the topic politically central in the age of globalization and philosophically interesting for nationalists and anti-nationalists alike.\nIn recent times, the philosophical focus has moved more in the direction of \u201cliberal nationalism\u201d, the view that mitigates the classical claims and tries to bring together the pro-national attitude and the respect for traditional liberal values. For instance, the territorial state as political unit is seen by classical nationalists as centrally \u201cbelonging\u201d to one ethnic-cultural group and as actively charged with protecting and promulgating its traditions. The liberal variety allows for \u201csharing\u201d of the territorial state with non-dominant ethnic groups. Consequences are varied and quite interested (for more see below, especially section 2.1)."}
