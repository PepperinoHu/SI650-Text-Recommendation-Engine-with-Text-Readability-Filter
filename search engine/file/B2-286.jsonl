His remarks may be seized upon by insurgents to stir anti-British sentiment, but the prince said he was only doing his job. Most of the time the helicopter acted more as a deterrent, he said. \nIn a series of interviews during his time based at Camp Bastion in Helmand Province, he hinted at the difficulty of reconciling the different roles in his life. The prince, known as Captain Wales in the army, explained his 'three mes'. \u201cOne in the army, one socially in my own private time and then one with the family and stuff like that. So there is a switch and I flick it when necessary.\u201d \nHe admitted he sometimes 'let himself down' with his laddish behaviour, which he put down to \u201cprobably being too much army and not enough prince\u201d, but he said he was entitled to privacy, too. \nIn another unusually frank exchange, he aimed biting criticism at the media, especially the Sun, the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph, three of the royal family\u2019s most ardent supporters in Fleet Street. He said he was particularly annoyed by articles comparing his role as an Apache co-pilot gunner to Spitfire crews waiting to scramble during the second world war. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that at all,\u201d he said. \nThe prince said his suspicion of the media was rooted in the treatment of his family when \u201cI was very small\u201d, but that he couldn\u2019t help monitoring the stories written about him. \u201cOf course I read them,\u201d the prince said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a story and something\u2019s been written about me, I want to know what\u2019s being said. But all it does is just upset me and anger me that people can get away with writing the stuff they do; not just about me, but about everything and everybody. My father always says, 'Don\u2019t read it'. Everyone says, 'Don\u2019t read it, because it\u2019s always rubbish'.\u201d \nThe prince was posted to Afghanistan last September to command a \u00a345m Apache helicopter \u2013 one of the military\u2019s most sophisticated and well-armed aircraft. During his tour, the Apaches flew missions supporting NATO troops fighting the Taliban and accompanied British Chinook and US Black Hawk medical helicopters during casualty evacuations. \nFour years ago, the prince had to be spirited out of Afghanistan during his first tour after a media embargo was broken by mistake by an Australian magazine. This time, the Ministry of Defence chose to publicize his deployment on the understanding that newspapers and broadcasters would not give a running commentary on his life out there to allow him to get on with his job. Two-man crews from the BBC, Sky and ITN were sent once each to report on his visit, while a photographer and a reporter from the Press Association were embedded on all three visits. \nAsked whether he felt more comfortable being Captain Wales than Prince Harry, his reply was one of the most revealing he has given about his relationship with Prince Charles. \u201cDefinitely. I\u2019ve always been like that. My father\u2019s always trying to remind me about who I am and stuff like that. But it\u2019s very easy to forget about who I am when I am in the army. Everyone\u2019s wearing the same uniform and doing the same kind of thing. I get on well with the lads and I enjoy my job. It really is as simple as that.\u201d \nShortly before he went to Afghanistan, the prince was caught in another media furore, when pictures emerged of him frolicking naked in Las Vegas during a private party. Harry said he had let himself down, but also blamed the media. \u201cI probably let myself down, I let my family down, I let other people down. But, at the end of the day, I was in a private area and there should be a certain amount of privacy that one should expect. It was probably a classic example of me probably being too much army, and not enough prince. It\u2019s a simple case of that. \n\u201cThe papers knew that I was going out to Afghanistan anyway, so the way I was treated from them I don\u2019t think is acceptable.\u201d He added, \u201cCertain people remind me, 'Remember who you are, so don\u2019t always drop your guard'.\u201d \nAsked where he and his brother\u2019s fascination with helicopters came from, he said, \u201cProbably the fact that you can only fit a certain amount of people in a helicopter, therefore no one can follow us, like you guys.\u201d"}
