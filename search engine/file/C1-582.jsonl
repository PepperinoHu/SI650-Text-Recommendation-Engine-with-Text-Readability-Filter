But Starbucks should be careful what it wishes for. \nThe direct action group UK Uncut plans to turn dozens of the coffee empire\u2019s UK branches into cr\u00e8ches, refuges and homeless shelters to highlight the chain\u2019s tax avoidance tactics. \nThe announcement of the action comes on the day a Starbucks executive faces questions from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee over why the company paid no corporation tax in the UK during the past three years, despite senior US management trumpeting the company\u2019s profitable operations in Britain. \nIn his appearance before the committee, Starbucks\u2019 Chief Financial Officer, Troy Alstead, will attempt to repair the company\u2019s reputation, which continues to suffer because of the controversy. \nMPs accused HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) officials of having cosy relationships with big businesses. Speaking about the arrangements with Starbucks, the Conservative MP Richard Bacon said: \u201cIt smells. And it doesn\u2019t smell of coffee \u2013 it smells bad.\u201d \nThe campaign group UK Uncut is attempting to draw a link between government cuts, in particular those that affect women, and tax avoidance by multinational businesses. \nSarah Greene, a UK Uncut activist, said funding for refuges and rape crisis centres faced cuts unless companies paid their fair share of tax. HMRC estimates around \u00a332bn was lost to tax avoidance in 2011. \nGreene said the government could easily bring in billions that could fund vital services by clamping down on tax avoidance. \nThe group, which rose to prominence after staging a sit-in at Vodafone stores, Topshop and Fortnum & Mason, turned its attentions to Starbucks last month after an investigation by Reuters discovered the company had paid only \u00a38.6m in corporation tax since launching in the UK in 1998, despite cumulative sales of \u00a33bn. \nLongstanding Uncut campaigner Anna Walker said \u201cWe\u2019ve chosen to really highlight the impact of the cuts on women. So there is going to be a real focus on transforming Starbucks into those services that are being cut by the government \u2026 [such as] refuges and cr\u00e8ches. \n\u201cStarbucks is a really great target because it is on every high street across the country and that\u2019s what UK Uncut finds really important: people can take action in their local areas,\u201d she said. \nSeveral international organizations have faced criticism over their UK accounts, with Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google and Ikea all paying little or no corporation tax despite large British operations. \nHowever, according to pollsters at YouGov\u2019s BrandIndex, Starbucks has suffered the deepest damage to its image. \nThe coffee store chain insists it pays the correct level of taxes. The group Chief Executive, Howard Schultz, has said in a statement: \u201cStarbucks has always paid taxes in the UK despite recent suggestions to the contrary. \n\u201cOver the last three years alone, our company has paid more than \u00a3160m in various taxes, including National Insurance contributions, VAT and business rates.\u201d \nMargaret Hodge, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, told parliament last month that Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google and Starbucks had avoided nearly \u00a3900m of tax. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, responded to the claim by saying: \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the current situation. I think [HMRC] needs to look at it very carefully. We do need to make sure we are encouraging these businesses to invest in our country as they are, but they should be paying fair taxes as well.\u201d \nA spokeswoman for Starbucks said: \u201cWhile the subject of tax law can be extremely complex, Starbucks respects and complies with tax laws and accounting rules in each of the 61 countries where we do business, including the UK \u2013 a market that we remain committed to for the long term. We\u2019ve posted the facts about our tax practices in the UK on our website. \n\u201cStarbucks\u2019 economic impact in the UK goes far beyond our stores and partners [employees]. We spend hundreds of millions of pounds with local suppliers on milk, cakes and sandwiches, and on store design and renovations. When you take into account the indirect employment created by Starbucks\u2019 investments in the UK, the company\u2019s extended economic impact to the UK economy exceeds \u00a380m annually. \n\u201cWe hope that UK Uncut will respect the wellbeing of our partners and customers, and recognize the value that we add to the economy, creating jobs and apprenticeships, as well as paying our fair share of taxes in the UK.\u201d"}
