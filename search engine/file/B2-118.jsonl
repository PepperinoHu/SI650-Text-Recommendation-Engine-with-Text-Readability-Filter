Bicycle shops have been slow to stock e-bikes, even though they have been around since the late 1990s. Sales in the US have been modest. \nPizzi, who is now CEO of Currie Technologies, the number one seller of e-bikes in the US, believes that\u2019s about to change. Others in the industry agree. Familiar brands including Trek, Raleigh and Specialized all offer electric models and they\u2019re betting the market is about to take off. \n\u201cWe\u2019re on the cusp of mainstream adoption,\u201d Pizzi said. \u201cThere are more players entering the category, it seems, with every passing month.\u201d \nThe US is an outlier when it comes to electric bikes. Nearly 32m e-bikes were sold in 2014, the vast majority in China, where they are primarily used for transportation. They are popular in much of Europe, too. They\u2019re common in the Netherlands and Switzerland; German postal workers use them to get around and BMW offers one for about $3,000. \nElectric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds, which rely on motorized power; they are bicycles that can be pedalled with \u2013 or without \u2013 assistance from an electric motor. Riding an e-bike feels like riding a conventional bike with a brisk tailwind; the motor helps you go faster or climb hills but it\u2019s typically not the primary source of propulsion. Unlike mopeds, e-bicycles are usually permitted on bike paths and they can\u2019t travel faster than 20mph. \nThere\u2019s debate about how many electric bikes are sold in the US and there is no official count. \nEstimates of annual sales range from about 50,000 to 175,000. That\u2019s comparable to the number of electric cars sold in the US \u2013 118,000 in 2014. Yet, while many people are aware of the Nissan Leaf, Chevy Volt and Tesla, few have heard of e-bike companies Currie, Pedego or ElectroBike. \nTo succeed, the electric bike business in the US must clear legal, cultural and financial hurdles. E-bikes are banned in some states, including New York, although the law isn\u2019t strictly enforced. Traditionalists who own and staff bike shops don\u2019t like putting motors on bicycles, citing, among other things, the added weight. Some e-bikes are close to 30kg. \nE-bikes are also pricey. While low-end models sell for as little as $700, Court Rye, the founder and editor of ElectricBikeReview.com, a popular website, says riders should expect to pay at least $1,500 for a quality e-bike with a good battery. Top-of-the-line models cost more than twice that. \nThe companies that make and sell e-bikes say they can overcome those obstacles. \nE-bike technology, particularly the batteries, is improving. \u201cBatteries are getting smaller, they\u2019re getting lighter, they\u2019re getting more reliable and they are lasting longer,\u201d says Don DiCostanza, the founder and CEO of Pedego, an electric bikemaker and retailer. \nCompanies like Bosch, the German electronics giant, and Shimano, the leading manufacturer of bicycle gears, are entering the business, which should help erode resistance from bike shops. \u201cThis has really caught the attention and the imagination of bicycle dealers,\u201d says Currie\u2019s Larry Pizzi. Pedego and startup ElectroBike aren\u2019t waiting for the shops to come around; they are building their own stores. In the meantime, lobbying efforts are underway to permit the use of e-bikes everywhere. \nPerhaps most importantly, as more cities build cycling infrastructure, including dedicated bike lanes, bicycle commuting has become more popular. As the US Census Bureau reported in 2014, the number of bike commuters grew from about 488,000 in 2000 to 786,000 in 2012. That\u2019s a \u201clarger percentage increase than that of any other commuting mode,\u201d the report notes. Electric bikes make commuting more practical \u2013 and fun \u2013 by easing worry about hills, headwinds, fatigue and sweat. \nMost of our customers are \u201cageing baby boomers who want to rekindle the experience they had as a kid,\u201d says Pedego\u2019s Don DiCostanza. \u201cThe main reason they stopped riding bikes was because of hills.\u201d Pedego has opened nearly 60 stores in the US and it has sold bikes to tour companies in San Francisco and Washington, DC. \nElectroBike, which operates 30 stores in Mexico, opened its first American store in Venice Beach, California in the autumn of 2014 and hopes to grow to 25 US stores in a year. CEO Craig Anderson says: \u201cWe want to help reduce traffic, help reduce our carbon footprint and promote a healthy lifestyle.\u201d He tells customers: \u201cRide this once and try not to smile.\u201d \nStartups like Pedego and ElectroBike will have to compete with big companies like Trek and Currie, which, in 2012, was acquired by the Accell Group, a public company based in the Netherlands that is Europe\u2019s market leader in e-bikes. Accell owns the Raleigh brand, as well as Haibike, an award-winning German electric bike. \n\u201cAccell has great expectations about e-bikes in North America,\u201d Currie\u2019s Larry Pizzi says. \u201cWhile baby boomers are still a very important segment, we\u2019re finding that a lot of younger people are using e-bikes for transportation, instead of cars.\u201d \nAccell\u2019s Yuba brand even sells a cargo bike with a stronger motor and rear rack. \u201cYou can carry two children,\u201d says Pizzi. \u201cYou can carry 45kg of shopping. It\u2019s a minivan alternative.\u201d"}
