{"id": "B2-278", "contents": "\ufeffSleep deprivation used to be a badge of honour: a sign you were busy and important and very much in demand. Snoozing was losing and sleep was for wimps. Now, however, Arianna Huffington\u2019s The Sleep Revolution, a 'call to bed' that promises to transform your life \u201cone night at a time\u201d, is a New York Times best-seller and Huffington is urging people to \u201csleep their way to the top\u201d. Meanwhile, the sleep industry has woken up big time and a whole range of start-ups are reinventing where, when and how we sleep, as well as how much we\u2019re prepared to pay for it. For the more upmarket snoozer, luxury hotels are offering \u201csleep retreats\u201d; more than $1,000 gets you dinner and a movie about sleep. And, if you\u2019re staying home, you can upgrade your bedroom with everything from a mattress cover with a sensor that tracks your sleep ($249) to a brainwave-monitoring sleeping mask that lets you nap more efficiently ($299). \nSleep hasn\u2019t just been corporatized \u2013 it has infiltrated corporations. A number of companies already have nap pods and Huffington predicts that nap rooms in offices are going to become \u201cas common as conference rooms\u201c in the next two years. So, how did this happen? How did sleep, something humans have done since long before Huffington awoke to it, suddenly become so fashionable? \nGetting enough sleep is a natural fit for the sort of lifestyle in which paying $10 for green juice and $34 for a SoulCycle class is the norm. Then, there\u2019s the rise of the quantified self through wearable technology. Our bodies have become input/output devices that we monitor and optimize for greater efficiency and sleep has become another data set to be tracked. What Huffington emphasizes about sleep, after all, is not that it rests you but that it restores you. Sleep, she says, is the ultimate performance enhancer and getting eight hours of rest has become the ultimate status symbol. \nYou know how Arianna Huffington gets her eight hours? Well, for one thing, she has \u201cnine or so\u201d assistants, according to a recent New York Times profile. Huffington calls them her \u201cA-Team\u201d; they do everything from running her errands to planning her travel to loading The Huffington Post on her computer in the morning. According to the Times, most of the A-Team can only endure about 12 months of the work because it\u2019s so taxing. The low pay also means many of them take second jobs. Basically, they don\u2019t sleep so that Huffington can \u2026 and can sell books about it. \nGetting enough sleep isn\u2019t just a question of valuing sleep enough to go to bed at the right time; it\u2019s a question of going to bed in the right neighbourhood and in the right body. Numerous studies show that you\u2019re more likely to sleep poorly if you\u2019re poor. It\u2019s hard to sleep if you\u2019re worried about your safety or haven\u2019t had enough to eat. It\u2019s hard to sleep if you\u2019re one of the 15 million American shift workers who work irregular hours. Research has also found that there\u2019s a black/white sleep gap. One study shows that, while white people sleep an average of 6.85 hours, African Americans sleep an average of 6.05 hours. They also have a lower quality of sleep. Researchers have attributed this, in part, to the stress of discrimination. \nWant to know who gets the most sleep and the best quality of sleep in America? Wealthy white women. Which, if I\u2019d hazard a guess, is probably the same demographic Huffington is targeting her book at. Huffington describes her promotion of sleep as a \u201crevolution\u201d but, really, it\u2019s a rebranding. The very real sleep crisis we face isn\u2019t down to a few rich people thinking it\u2019s a waste of time; it\u2019s down to the 99% not being able to afford to spend time sleeping. \nWhile sleep is currently enjoying a moment, it will probably be short-lived. Sleep may be a performance enhancer but it\u2019s an inefficient one. The real prize is finding a way to negate sleep deprivation so humans can function on less sleep. Unsurprisingly, the military is at the forefront of this research. In 2008, the Pentagon published a report called \u201cHuman Performance\u201d which examined the possibility of a future in which soldiers could perform at their peak with only a couple of hours\u2019 sleep. \u201cSuppose a human could be engineered who slept for the same amount of time as a giraffe (1.9 hours per night). \nThis would lead to an approximately twofold decrease in the casualty rate. An adversary would need an approximately 40% increase in the troop level to compensate for this advantage.\u201d The report goes on to look at the effects of ampakines, a class of drugs that modulate neurotransmitters in the brain, to remove the effects of sleep deprivation. \nEventually, humans will figure out a way to get rid of sleep. Spending a third of your life unconscious won\u2019t be a luxury anymore; it\u2019ll be something only the poor will be forced to do. At which point, we may need a whole new sort of sleep revolution."}
