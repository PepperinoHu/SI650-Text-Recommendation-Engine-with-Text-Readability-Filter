It's filthy!\nIt's not so bad, mom.\nI don't even remember what color the carpet is!\nIt's blue, I remember.\nHave you no shame?\nWhat should I be ashamed of?\nThere are clothes all over the ground!\nIt's just easier to leave them there.\nYour floor is not a gigantic closet.\nI never said it was.\nClean your room or you can't go out today.\nFine, fine. I'll clean it now."}
